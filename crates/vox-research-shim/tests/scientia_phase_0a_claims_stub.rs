    // no numeric bonus, no penalty) and `>= min_score` lets it through — so a

    // gate's own scoring formula) accepted as a "claim" and short-circuits
    // this test before the LLM cascade under test ever runs. A hedge-heavy
    // sentence pushes the score below threshold and is rejected by the gate,
    // so this test actually exercises the LLM-cascade fail-closed path it is
    // named for, rather than being satisfied by the deterministic extractor.
