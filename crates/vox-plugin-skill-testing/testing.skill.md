# Vox Testing Skill

Provides test execution and coverage tooling for the Vox workspace.

## Tools

- `vox_run_tests` — run `cargo test` for a specific crate pattern
- `vox_test_all` — run the full test suite across all crates

## Usage

Run `vox_test_all` before merging any branch.
Use `vox_run_tests` with a crate name to quickly validate a single component.
Always run tests after modifying schema migrations or public APIs.
