//! Peer directory — what replaces the HTTP `federation_directory()` endpoint.
//!
//! The old directory was a list a control plane *asserted*. This one is a list
//! the network *demonstrates*: every entry was reachable and answered a `Probe`
//! just now. A peer that is trusted but switched off is simply absent, which is
//! what the model selector needs — it must not route work to a dark machine.
//!
//! Consumers are `vox-orchestrator`'s `registry.rs`, `catalog.rs` and
//! `task_submit.rs` (plan Task 3.2). That wiring needs a
//! `vox-orchestrator -> vox-mesh-transport` crate edge, which is
//! user-authorised-only, so it is proposed rather than taken here.
