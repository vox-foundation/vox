// TODO(VUV-10+): currently this rule only enforces consistency for
// `RenameKind::Primitive`. Decorator and Kwarg consistency rules
// belong in their respective registries (when those rename kinds
// are first used by future VUV phases). EnumValue and Type
// consistency requires reflective access to those name sets which
// is not yet exposed; add when the first such rename lands.

//! VUV-9 Task 8: every `from` of kind `Primitive` in the rename registry must
//! NOT be a current canonical primitive name. The registry alone resolves old
//! names; the parser must not still recognize them.
//!
//! Today: registry is empty — test passes trivially.
//! Tomorrow: when we deprecate a primitive, the rename entry MUST be added in
//! the same commit that removes the primitive from the canonical set.
