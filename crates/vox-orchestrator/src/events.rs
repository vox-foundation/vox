// Tier classification (T1.2: two-tier append-before-broadcast)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// **Tier A** (durable-before-broadcast): dispatch-lifecycle transitions that
// T1.1 wired into the durable op-log via `Orchestrator::record_operation` —
// task submit/complete/fail, HITL approval request/resolve, soft-HITL
// feedback request/resolve, task-doubt, and hopper admit/assign/complete.
// These fire at most a few times per second, so paying an oplog append (and,
// via `append_to_db_with_breaker`, an eventual durable write) per event is
// cheap. Production call sites MUST durably record a Tier-A transition
// *before* broadcasting the corresponding `AgentEventKind` on the
// [`EventBus`] — see `Orchestrator::record_operation`'s doc comment and the
// call sites in `vox-orchestrator-mcp/src/{dispatch,feedback_tools}.rs`,
// `vox-orchestrator/src/orchestrator/{task_dispatch,agent/doubt,dispatch}.rs`,
// and `vox-orchestrator/src/orch_daemon/mod.rs`.
//
// **Tier B** (broadcast-only, never durably journaled): everything else —
// `TokenStreamed`, heartbeats, throughput/cost ticks, lock/diag chatter, and
// any other high-frequency or purely observational event. These can fire
// hundreds of times per second (e.g. one `TokenStreamed` per LLM token);
// fsync-per-append here was explicitly rejected as a design (it would bloat
// the op-log and stall the hot path on disk I/O). Tier-B events are pure
// broadcast: no durable record, no undo/redo, no replay. The recovery
// contract for a crashed/restarted daemon is "resume from the last committed
// Tier-A transition" — never mid-token, never mid-heartbeat.
//
// `AgentEventKind` is not `#[non_exhaustive]`, so [`is_tier_a`] is written as
// an exhaustive match: adding a new variant without extending this match is a
// compile error, which is the enforcement mechanism (a future contributor is
// forced to make an explicit tier decision rather than silently defaulting).

/// Returns `true` if `kind` is a **Tier A** event: a dispatch-lifecycle
/// transition that must be durably recorded (via `Orchestrator::record_operation`)
/// *before* being broadcast on the [`EventBus`]. See the module-level tier
/// documentation above.
