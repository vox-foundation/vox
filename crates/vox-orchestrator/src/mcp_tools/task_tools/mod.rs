//! Task management tool handlers for the Vox MCP server.
//!
//! Covers: submit, status, complete, fail, cancel, reorder, drain, and publish.
//!
//! ## Policy side effects
//! Submit/status paths participate in **interruption / attention policy** ([`super::attention_policy`]): they may call
//! [`ServerState::record_attention_event`](crate::mcp_tools::server_state::ServerState::record_attention_event) and read trust snapshots when
//! questioning backlog or human-confirmation gates apply. That is **budget-plane telemetry**, not remote product analytics.
