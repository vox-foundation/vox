//! MlBackend extension-point trait — the first real code-plugin extension.
//!
//! Implementations live in plugins like `vox-plugin-mens-candle-cuda`.
//! The host obtains an instance via `VoxPlugin::as_ml_backend()` and dispatches
//! training / eval / checkpoint operations through it.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! For `train_step` and `eval_step`, batch payloads are serialized as JSON
//! strings rather than typed `StableAbi` payloads. This keeps the trait
//! shape stable while the schema for batches and stats can evolve via
//! plain-Rust serde types defined in the calling crate. If JSON ser/de
//! shows up as a hot-path cost in profiles, switch to a bincode-encoded
//! `RVec<u8>` in a future trait revision.
