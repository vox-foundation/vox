//! Self-healing for the Candle runtime plugins.
//!
//! `vox mens train --device cuda` dispatches QLoRA training to a runtime-loaded
//! cdylib plugin (`mens-candle-cuda`). Two failure modes make a plain train
//! command fail out of the box:
//!
//! 1. **Missing** — the plugin was never installed.
//! 2. **Version/ABI mismatch** — the installed dll was built against an older
//!    workspace version (`plugin.load_failed error_kind="root_module"`).
//!
//! When auto-heal is enabled (default; opt out with `--no-auto-heal` or
//! `VOX_MENS_NO_AUTO_HEAL=1`), the device-specific ensure function re-fetches a
//! verified release artifact for the plugin and reinstalls it before training
//! proceeds.
//!
//! This does **not** compile anything at runtime. An earlier revision of this
//! module rebuilt the cdylib from in-tree source with `cargo build` — on
//! Windows wrapped in a Visual Studio developer environment so `nvcc` could
//! find `cl.exe`, with `CUDA_PATH`/`CUDA_HOME` pinned to the newest installed
//! toolkit. That assumed a Rust toolchain, a CUDA toolkit, and a repo
//! checkout — none of which an installed end user has (spec §4.1 P6: no
//! runtime cargo). Auto-heal now shells out to the already-built `vox`
//! binary's own `plugin install` subcommand instead; see
//! [`reinstall_via_vox_plugin_install`] for why that's a subprocess call
//! rather than a library dependency, and why it's found by name on `PATH`
//! rather than via `std::env::current_exe()`.
//!
//! This module is only compiled with the `gpu` feature, which is what makes
//! `vox-plugin-host` available.

/// lives in `vox-cli`, a downstream binary crate. Depending on it directly
/// from here would add a `vox-ml-cli` → `vox-cli` crate-graph edge, which is
/// architecturally backwards (a library-ish crate depending on a downstream
/// binary's command internals) and would need a user-authorized entry in
/// `contracts/ci/crate-edges.allow.v1.json` that this code cannot grant
/// itself. So instead this shells out to the already-built `vox` binary as a
/// subprocess — turning the exact command
/// [`vox_plugin_host::format_install_hint`] already prints to the user into a
/// programmatic auto-heal call.
///
/// # Why a PATH lookup, not `std::env::current_exe()`
/// `vox-ml-cli` ships as a SEPARATE binary from `vox` (see
/// `contracts/distribution/profiles.v1.yaml`'s `full` tier: `[vox,
/// vox-ml-cli, voxup]`), so `std::env::current_exe()` here would resolve to
/// `vox-ml-cli`'s own path, never `vox`'s — there is no reliable on-disk
/// relationship between the two binaries to exploit. A plain `"vox"` PATH
/// lookup matches `format_install_hint`'s own assumption that `vox` is on
/// PATH, and needs no packaging-layout knowledge.
///
/// Does not fall back to compiling anything: if `vox` is not on `PATH`, this
/// fails with an actionable message rather than silently rebuilding from
/// source — that fallback is exactly the runtime-cargo dependency this
/// module removes.
/// Resolve the `vox` binary, preferring the one sitting beside THIS binary
/// over whatever `vox` a PATH lookup happens to find first.
///
/// `Command::new("vox")` alone is a hijack vector: any directory earlier on
/// PATH containing an executable named `vox` gets run instead, with this
/// process's privileges, from inside the auto-heal path of a security
/// hardening feature. Installers put `vox` and `vox-ml-cli` in the same
/// directory, so the sibling lookup succeeds in the normal case and PATH stays
/// as the fallback for development checkouts where they are built separately.
///
/// `current_exe()` cannot be used directly for this -- it resolves to
/// vox-ml-cli's own path, never vox's -- but its PARENT is exactly the
