//! Legacy-only migration surfaces.
//!
//! This module is the explicit boundary for transitional pathways that should not
//! grow as first-class peers to baseline schema surfaces.
//!
//! Deletion criteria:
//! - pre-baseline `schema_version` chain upgrades are no longer supported in release policy
//! - legacy JSONL import/export workflows have no remaining operator dependents
//! - extended Ludus cutover DDL is fully represented by baseline schema fragments
