//! CR-L8 corpus-feedback loop — end-to-end proof.
//!
//! Drives a real Vox fixture with three retired patterns through
//! [`vox_code_audit::ToestubEngine`], captures the emitted `LintFinding`
//! events via a `BufferedRecorder`, runs them through the CR-L8 aggregator,
//! and asserts the resulting `CorpusFeedbackReport` carries the expected
//! per-rule rollup with the correct counts.
//!
//! This is the single test that proves the *whole loop* lands a real
//! measurement: emitter → event → aggregator → report. Lives in `tests/` so
//! the `set_global_recorder` `OnceLock` starts fresh for this binary, freeing
//! us from interference with `vox-code-audit`'s own integration tests.
//!
//! Single `#[test]` rather than multiple — `set_global_recorder` is
//! first-writer-wins via `OnceLock`, so we register exactly once per binary
//! and exercise every assertion sequentially.
//!
//! Council-ratified 2026-05-15 (A3 in the v1-llm-target-implementation-plan
//! Tier-A batch closing the P2.1c work).
