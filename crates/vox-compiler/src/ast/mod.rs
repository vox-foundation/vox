//! Abstract syntax tree (AST) for the Vox language.
//!
//! This crate is **compiler-internal**: `vox-parser` builds these trees from tokens; `vox-hir`
//! lowers them; `vox-typeck` and codegen consume HIR. The AST is **lossy only where the parser
//! chooses not to model trivia**—names are **not** resolved: `Ident` and `Named` types carry
//! spellings as written, and it is up to later passes to bind them to definitions.
//!
//! # Layout
//! - [`decl`] — one file becomes a [`decl::Module`] of [`decl::Decl`] items (functions, tables, routes, …).
//! - [`expr`] — expression tree inside bodies; shares [`span::Span`] with statements and patterns.
//! - [`stmt`] — `let` / `ret` / expression statements; blocks in `expr` embed statements.
//! - [`pattern`] — `let` and `match` patterns; must align with [`expr::Expr::Match`] arms.
//! - [`types`] — type **syntax** only (generics, `fn(…) -> …`); not the internal type algebra.
//!
//! # Spans
//! [`crate::ast::span`] is **byte offsets into the original UTF-8 source** (`start` inclusive, `end` exclusive).
//! Diagnostics and LSP use these directly; they are not grapheme- or line-aware.
//!
//! See `docs/src/reference/lexicon.md` for naming aligned with the grammar.
