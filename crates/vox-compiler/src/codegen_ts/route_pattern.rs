//! Route-pattern parser and segment-aware overlap detection.
//!
//! Phase C of the Svelte-mineable features implementation plan upgrades the
//! existing exact-string-match conflict detection at
//! [`super::routes`] (a `HashSet<(Method, String)>` of literal paths) to
//! segment-aware overlap detection that catches `/users/:id` vs `/users/me`
//! ambiguity at compile time. This module is the pure utility layer; the
//! integration into the route emitter is a separate change.
//!
//! Grammar accepted by [`RoutePattern::parse`]:
//! - Empty path `""` or `"/"` — root.
//! - Slash-separated segments.
//! - A segment beginning with `:` is a parameter (e.g. `:id`); the remainder is the
//!   parameter name.
//! - A `*` segment is a wildcard absorbing the rest of the path.
//! - Any other segment is a literal.
//!
//! Two patterns *overlap* when there exists a concrete path that both could match.
//! See [`Overlap`] for the precedence resolution rule.
