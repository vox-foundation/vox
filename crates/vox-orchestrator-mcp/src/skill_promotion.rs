//! Task 3.3 (harness parity plan): promotion pipeline that turns a
//! `skill_candidates` row (`status = 'pending'`, written by the miners in
//! `vox-skill-discovery` via `vox skill suggest`, see Task 3.2) into a real,
//! usable skill.
//!
//! ## What this module deliberately is and is not
//!
//! This is a scoped-down **vertical slice**, not full-fidelity implementation
//! of all 8 gates described in the harness parity plan. Each gate function
//! below documents its own fidelity; three are explicitly reduced-fidelity
//! starting points with a documented gap, not fake "always pass" stubs:
//!
//! * **Gate 1 (execution)** — `MinedOp` (`vox_skill_discovery::op_miner`),
//!   the only miner wired to `skill_candidates` today, records tool-call
//!   sequences with **no success/failure field at all**. So "did this
//!   actually run successfully" cannot be checked from `raw_json` as it
//!   exists today — this is a real gap, not something satisfied by
//!   construction. [`gate_execution`] instead does the check that *is*
//!   possible: the raw trajectory must deserialize to a well-formed,
//!   non-empty `vox_skill_discovery::Candidate`. Tracking real
//!   success/failure needs a schema change to `MinedOp`/`agent_operations`
//!   (`is_error` already exists on `agent_operations` — a follow-up could
//!   thread it through the miner) — flagged as a follow-up task, not solved
//!   here.
//! * **Gate 3 (dedupe)** — uses `vox-similarity`'s real simhash/hamming API
//!   (this crate *does* exist with a usable dedup primitive, confirming the
//!   plan's design target), comparing the candidate's name+description
//!   shingle simhash against existing skills' simhash. This is the
//!   documented-as-simple form: whole-value simhash + a hamming threshold,
//!   not `vox-similarity`'s fuller LSH/cluster index — good enough to catch
//!   near-identical candidates, not a semantic dedup.
//! * **Gate 5 (generality)** — counts rows sharing `candidate_name` via the
//!   new `count_skill_candidates_by_name` op; "same underlying skill" is
//!   approximated by exact name match (the miner already derives
//!   `candidate_name` deterministically from the mined pattern, so repeat
//!   mining runs naturally re-propose the same name for the same recurring
//!   pattern). A follow-up could cluster by trajectory similarity instead of
//!   exact name for a looser notion of "same skill".
//! * **Gate 6 (no known counter-examples)** — nothing in this codebase
//!   currently records *failures* of an installed/attempted skill tied back
//!   to a `skill_candidates` row (no `skill_failures` table, no negative
//!   signal in `reliability_scores` scoped to candidates pre-promotion).
//!   [`gate_no_known_counterexamples`] is therefore an honest pass-through
//!   documented as vacuously true today — flagged as a follow-up, not
//!   fabricated.
//!
//! Gates 2, 4, 7, 8 are implemented at real fidelity:
//!
//! * **Gate 2 (abstraction)** — [`abstract_candidate`] turns the raw
//!   `vox_skill_discovery::Candidate` into a [`CandidateSkillDraft`] (name,
//!   description, source body) sized to what mined data can actually
//!   support today. It is deliberately *not* a full
//!   `vox_plugin_types::skill_manifest::SkillManifest` — a real manifest
//!   requires `category`/`permissions` that mined trajectories don't carry
//!   (permissions in particular must never be inferred; they need an
//!   explicit human or policy decision). Constructing the installable
//!   manifest from a confirmed draft is left as a follow-up once a
//!   permission-assignment story exists.
//! * **Gate 4 (independent verification)** — [`gate_independent_verification`]
//!   is generic over an async judge closure so it is unit-testable without a
//!   network call; [`llm_chat_judge`] is the real production judge wired to
//!   `vox_actor_runtime::llm::llm_chat`, gated by the same
//!   `VOX_INFERENCE_PRIVACY` hard filter used elsewhere (Task 2.2) via
//!   `vox_orchestrator::route_policy::is_local_http_provider`. Returns a
//!   3-way [`VerificationOutcome`] (`Approved`/`Rejected`/
//!   `VerificationError`), not a plain pass/fail — a judge *rejection* is a
//!   permanent verdict, while a failed verification *call* (timeout,
//!   unreachable model, privacy denial) is transient and should leave the
//!   candidate `pending` for retry rather than kill it. Known limitation:
//!   `skill_candidates` does not record which model produced the
//!   mined trajectory (the miners are static analyzers, not model calls —
//!   there is no "generating model" to diff against), so "verification by a
//!   *different* model" reduces to "verification by *a* model the operator
//!   configured as a judge, respecting the privacy hard filter" rather than
//!   an enforced difference from an originating model. Documented, not
//!   silently reinterpreted.
//! * **Gate 7 (shadow-period state machine)** — [`Lifecycle`] mirrors
//!   `vox_orchestrator::models::autonomic::ModelConfidence` exactly in shape
//!   (Provisional/Confirmed/Deprecated; there is no `Shadowed` distinct
//!   state here because "shadow period" for a skill *is* the Provisional
//!   state — it is presented for use but not yet promotion-eligible).
//! * **Gate 8 (provenance binding)** — [`gate_provenance`] hashes `raw_json`
//!   with the same `blake3` dependency `vox-similarity` already uses, and
//!   compares against the `source_hash` bound at first promotion; a mismatch
//!   forces `Lifecycle::Provisional` (re-verification) instead of silently
//!   overwriting a `Confirmed` skill.
