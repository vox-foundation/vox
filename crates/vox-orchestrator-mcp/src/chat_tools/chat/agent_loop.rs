//! Task 1.3c (harness implementation spec §3.3): the real multi-turn, tool-calling
//! agent loop — the piece that finally wires together Tasks 1.1 (conversation
//! history), 1.2 (tool selection), 1.3a (tool_calls parsed from the wire response),
//! and 1.3b (tool_calls/tool_call_id carried on request messages).
//!
//! Finding F24 ("no code path in Vox ever passes tools to a model"): before this
//! module, every chat completion built its request with `tools: None`. This module
//! is the first that (a) selects a bounded tool subset for the turn
//! ([`crate::llm_bridge::tool_selection::select_tools_for_turn`]), (b) sends it to
//! the model via [`vox_actor_runtime::llm::llm_chat`] (the only call path that
//! carries `tools`/`tool_calls` end to end — see Task 1.3a/1.3b), (c) dispatches any
//! requested calls through [`crate::dispatch::handle_tool_call_with_mode`], and (d)
//! feeds the results back to the model as `role: "tool"` messages, looping until the
//! model stops requesting tools or a hard iteration bound is hit.
//!
//! Deliberately out of scope here (see Task 1.3c notes in the harness implementation
//! spec): per-turn skill-pin plumbing for `active_skill_id` (the caller can pass one
//! in if it has it cheaply at hand; this module does not go hunting for it), and any
//! new permission-mode taxonomy or dispatch mechanism — `permission_mode` is passed
//! straight through to `handle_tool_call_with_mode` exactly as that function already
//! requires (an authenticated transport-layer value, never LLM-composed).
