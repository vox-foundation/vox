# Vox Memory Skill

Provides the full persistent memory system: facts, daily logs, knowledge graph, and session management.

## Tools

- `vox_memory_store` — persist a key-value fact with optional related concept edges
- `vox_memory_recall` — retrieve a fact by key
- `vox_memory_search` — search logs and MEMORY.md by keyword
- `vox_memory_log` — append to today's daily log
- `vox_knowledge_query` — traverse the knowledge graph for related concepts
- `vox_session_*` — create, list, compact, and clean up agent sessions

## Usage

Always call `vox_memory_store` when you learn an important fact about the project.
Use `vox_knowledge_query` to find contextually related information before starting a new task.
Call `vox_session_compact` before context window overflow to preserve session history.
