## Socrates telemetry (chat / plan / inline / ghost)

Tools backed by `vox-mcp/src/tools/chat_tools.rs` (`vox_chat_message`, `vox_plan`, `vox_inline_edit`, `vox_ghost_text`) include a JSON **`socrates`** object on success: `risk_decision` (`answer` \| `ask` \| `abstain`), `confidence_estimate`, `contradiction_ratio`, aligned with `vox_socrates_policy::ConfidencePolicy`. The default system prompt (and ghost FIM system prompt) also embed grounding rules from the same policy. When the MCP server has **`VoxDb` attached**, each successful turn is appended asynchronously to Codex `research_metrics` (`metric_type = socrates_surface`, `session_id = mcp:<repository_id>`) for drift / proxy hallucination-risk monitoring; see `VoxDb::record_socrates_surface_event` in `vox-db`.
