# Installing Vox

This is the **canonical** installation page. Every other install snippet in the
repository is one command plus a link back here.

Vox is pre-1.0 (workspace version 0.6.0). **The path that works today is
`cargo install` from a checkout.** `voxup` is the intended rustup-style
installer, but there are **no published GitHub Releases** for it to download —
see [Packaging status](#packaging-status).

## Quick install (from source)

**Prerequisites:** Rust **1.98.1** (`rust-toolchain.toml`; workspace
`rust-version` is 1.96), Node.js >= 18 (frontend scaffolding), and a C compiler
(gcc / clang / MSVC).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox.git
cd vox
cargo install --locked --path crates/vox-cli
vox doctor
```

Always pass `--locked`: it installs against the workspace `Cargo.lock`. This
exact argument vector is the `CARGO_INSTALL_CLI_FROM_SOURCE` constant in
`crates/vox-cli/src/utils/install_policy/mod.rs`.

Restart your terminal if `vox` is not on `PATH`, then verify:

```bash
vox --version
```

`cargo install` puts `vox` on your Cargo bin path (`~/.cargo/bin` by default).

## Planned: voxup (not working end-to-end)

When a **published** (non-draft) GitHub Release exists, `voxup` is the intended
one-liner. **Do not pipe the live URL into a shell today** — `https://voxlang.org/voxup`
has 404'd, and `voxup` ignores draft releases that CI creates.

The in-repo scripts (no arguments, no flags) are what the published URLs will
serve:

```bash
sh scripts/install.sh        # macOS / Linux
.\scripts\install.ps1        # Windows (PowerShell)
```

`docs-astro/public/voxup` and `docs-astro/public/voxup.ps1` must stay
byte-identical to `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` (enforced by
`documented_install_urls_are_served`). Edit one, copy to the other in the same
commit.

What the script will do once releases exist:

1. Detect your platform and map it to a release target
   (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
   `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). aarch64 Linux has no release asset and the script
   tells you to build from source.
2. Query the GitHub Releases API for the newest **published** release of
   `vox-foundation/vox` (drafts are skipped).
3. Download `voxup-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz` and `checksums.txt`, and verify
   SHA-256.
4. Extract and run `voxup install default`.

Targets and artifact layout: [binary release contract](../ci/binary-release-contract.md).

When that path works, it will install:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `~/.vox/bin/vox` | The Vox CLI (real binary from the release archive) |
| `~/.vox/bin/voxup` | The installer binary (used by `voxup update`) |
| `~/.vox/toolchains/vox-<version>/` | Versioned toolchain directory |
| `~/.vox/toolchains/active` | Active version number (plain text) |

`~/.vox/bin` is appended to your shell `PATH`. Update with `voxup update` once
a newer published release exists.

## Building from source (development)

For a development build without installing:

```bash
cargo build -p vox-cli
```

### Installing voxup itself from source

```bash
cargo install --locked --path crates/voxup
voxup install default
```

## Beyond the CLI

`cargo install --locked --path crates/vox-cli` and `voxup` give you the **CLI
only**. `vox doctor` will keep reporting these as missing until you add them
separately — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full table.

The one that is easy to get wrong:

```bash
cargo install --locked --path crates/vox-ml-cli --features populi
```

`populi` is a **non-default** feature of `vox-ml-cli`. A bare
`cargo install --path crates/vox-ml-cli` compiles the default `mens-base`
feature set and yields a binary with no mesh transport, so `vox populi` cannot
serve. The path and required feature are recorded as
`SOURCE_INSTALL_ML_CLI_REL_PATH` and `CARGO_INSTALL_ML_CLI_FROM_SOURCE` in
`crates/vox-cli/src/utils/install_policy/mod.rs`.

## Packaging status

| Channel | Status today |
|---|---|
| `cargo install --locked --path crates/vox-cli` | **Working.** Requires a checkout and a Rust toolchain. |
| `voxup` one-liner (`https://voxlang.org/voxup`, `/voxup.ps1`) | **Not published.** Script exists in-repo; live URL has 404'd; `voxup` needs a published (non-draft) GitHub Release. |
| GitHub Release archives | **Not published.** CI can create **draft** releases; nothing is published for `voxup` to consume. |
| Homebrew tap | **Not published.** The release job builds and hashes a macOS tarball but the tap-update step is a placeholder; no `vox-foundation/homebrew-vox` formula is dispatched. |
| Windows `.msi` | **Not published.** The `cargo wix --no-build` job has no preceding `cargo build --profile dist`, so it has no binary to package, and nothing is uploaded. |
| Debian `.deb` | **Not published.** `cargo deb` does build the package, but no step uploads it to the release. |

Do not tell users to `brew install`, download an `.msi`, or `apt install` vox
until those jobs actually publish artifacts.

## Verify your environment

```bash
vox doctor
```

| Check | Required? | How to fix |
|---|---|---|
| Rust 1.98.1 (`rust-toolchain.toml`; workspace `rust-version` is 1.96) | Yes | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| Node.js >= 18 | Optional | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Git | Yes | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) |
| C compiler (MSVC / gcc / clang) | Yes | Platform-specific, see below |
| clang / LLVM | Optional | The workspace patches **`aegis`** with **`pure-rust`** defaults, so a typical Windows + MSVC build does **not** need `clang-cl` for Turso. Install LLVM only if you hit a toolchain that still expects native crypto builds. |
| Google AI Studio key | Recommended | Free at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| OpenRouter key | Optional | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |
| Ollama | Optional | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) |
| VoxDB directory writable | Yes | `~/.vox/` must exist and be writable |

## AI provider keys

Vox uses a three-layer model cascade — you get free AI with just a Google
account.

### Layer 1: Google AI Studio (free, primary)

No credit card required. Provides Gemini 2.5 Flash, Flash-Lite, and Pro.

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Layer 2: OpenRouter (optional)

A free key unlocks dozens of `:free` models; a paid key unlocks frontier models.

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

### Layer 3: Ollama (optional, local)

Zero-auth local inference. Install Ollama, pull a model, and Vox auto-detects it
on `localhost:11434`.

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

## Docker

```bash
# Build from source
docker build -t vox .

# Optional: image with `vox populi` (HTTP control plane)
docker build -t vox:mens --build-arg VOX_CLI_FEATURES=mens .

# Run MCP server
docker run -e GEMINI_API_KEY=... -p 3000:3000 vox

# MCP + in-container mens sidecar (background `vox populi serve` on 9847)
docker run -e VOX_MESH_MESH_SIDECAR=1 -e GEMINI_API_KEY=... -p 3000:3000 -p 9847:9847 vox:mens

# Full stack with docker compose
cp .env.example .env  # fill in GEMINI_API_KEY
docker compose up
```

An example multi-service mens compose file lives at `examples/mens-compose.yml`.

## Platform notes

### Windows

- **MSVC (C++):** `winget install -e --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`
  (include the **Desktop development with C++** workload when prompted).
- **clang-cl (Turso / aegis):** `winget install -e --id LLVM.LLVM` so
  `clang-cl.exe` is on `PATH` (usually `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin`). Only needed
  if a native crypto build is required.
- **WSL:** running `sh scripts/install.sh` inside WSL avoids MSVC / clang-cl
  friction for some workflows.

### macOS

- **C compiler:** `xcode-select --install` (ships `clang`).
- **Turso:** usually satisfied by the Xcode Command Line Tools; if `aegis` still
  fails, `brew install llvm` and follow Homebrew's `PATH` notes.

### Linux

- **C compiler:** `sudo apt-get install build-essential` (Debian / Ubuntu).
- **clang (recommended for Turso):** `sudo apt-get install clang`.
