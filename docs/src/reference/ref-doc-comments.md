# Reference: documentation comments

Vox does **not** currently define a Rust-style `///` / `///!` doc-comment syntax in the lexer. Author-facing documentation lives primarily in:

- This reference section (`docs/src/reference/`).
- Architecture and SSOT pages (`docs/src/architecture/`).
- Executable golden examples under `examples/golden/` with `@test` blocks ([test-first policy](../../../AGENTS.md)).

## Markdown and fenced code

Per root [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md):

- Fenced blocks tagged **`vox`** in docs may use `{{#include}}` from `examples/golden/` or mark illustrative snippets with `// vox:skip`.
- Other fenced languages are not run through the Vox parser by default.

## Building the docs book

- CLI entry: see [`reference/cli.md`](./cli.md) (`build-docs` / mdBook wiring).
