# MCP HTTP read-role governance contract

Machine-readable governance profile for MCP HTTP read-token tool scope lives at:

**[`contracts/mcp/http-read-role-governance.yaml`](../../../contracts/mcp/http-read-role-governance.yaml)** (from repo root)

Schema:
**[`contracts/mcp/http-read-role-governance.schema.json`](../../../contracts/mcp/http-read-role-governance.schema.json)**

This contract defines the canonical set of tool names expected to carry
`http_read_role_eligible: true` in the MCP tool registry.

## Enforcement

- `vox ci command-compliance` validates the governance profile against schema.
- `vox ci command-compliance` enforces parity between:
  - governance profile `read_role_tools`
  - MCP tool registry entries with `http_read_role_eligible: true`
