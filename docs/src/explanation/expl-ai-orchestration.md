# AI Agent Orchestration

Vox was built from the ground up to blur the lines between traditional application logic and AI agent capabilities. Rather than bolting an AI SDK onto a web framework, Vox uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and its internal **DEI (Distributed Execution Intelligence) Orchestrator** as first-class citizens.

## The MCP Bridge

The Model Context Protocol establishes a standard way for AI assistants (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or your own models) to safely discover and interact with local data sources and tools.

Vox seamlessly generates MCP servers natively from the logic you've already written.

### `@mcp.tool`

The `@mcp.tool` decorator tells the Vox compiler to expose a function to any connected LLM. 

```vox
// Skip-Test
@mcp.tool "Calculate the shipping cost including surge pricing"
fn calculate_shipping(weight: float, zip_code: str) -> float {
    // Logic here
}
```

Behind the scenes, Vox:
1. Derives the JSON Schema for the inputs (`weight` as a number, `zip_code` as a string).
2. Generates an asynchronous Rust handler.
3. Maps Vox `Result` types directly to MCP error structures so the LLM knows *why* an operation failed without you writing serialization glue.

### `@mcp.resource`

While tools are functions the LLM can call, resources are data the LLM can read. 

```vox
// Skip-Test
@mcp.resource("vox://user/config", "The current user's profile configuration")
fn get_user_profile() -> str {
    return db.query("SELECT context FROM config")
}
```

The DEI orchestrator handles registering this URI schema. When an LLM requests `vox://user/config`, the orchestrator routes it directly to this function.

## DEI Orchestrator

The **Distributed Execution Intelligence (DEI)** orchestrator (sometimes referred to as `vox-dei`) is the runtime engine that manages these agents and tools.

When you run `vox run src/main.vox`, the orchestrator spins up, discovers all your decorated tools, and starts an MCP endpoint that defaults to Stdio for desktop clients or HTTP/SSE for distributed meshes.

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Messaging

Agents are scoped types in Vox. While the syntax is still aspirational (`@agent type`), the DEI orchestrator fundamentally supports *Agent-to-Agent (A2A) messaging*. 

One agent can be granted the tools of another agent, executing what is effectively a sub-agent handoff. Because tools are just compiled Vox functions, a handoff entails an in-memory or fast-WASI call rather than a network hop to a secondary Python server.

## Security Controls

Because Vox exposes functions directly to reasoning engines, security is modeled differently than traditional web frameworks. The AI is bounded by the exact strictures of the Vox language: zero-null data, strict ADT matching, and the explicit `@require(condition)` precondition decorators, ensuring the LLM cannot hallucinate paths to execute invalid data modifications.
