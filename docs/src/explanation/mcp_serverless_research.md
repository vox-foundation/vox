# Research Notes: Achieving Serverless-like Performance with MCP

## Context
The goal is to analyze what can be learned from connectionless or "serverless" paradigms like UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol or conceptually connectionless protocols like UDP) -> enhance the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Vox. We want to decrease overhead and improve performance while maintaining the power and compatibility of the existing MCP standard.

## Findings & Enhancements for MCP

### 1. In-Memory Short-Circuiting (Fast Path)
Native Vox tools (like `read_file` or `write_file`) should completely bypass standard MCP JSON-RPC over stdio when called from an internal agent.
- **How to apply:** Implement a `NativeToolRegistry` that handles native file-system tool requests synchronously and in-process. This removes serialization, pipe overhead, and latency constraints.

### 2. Prompt Caching & Schema LRU
MCP often suffers from redundant schema transmissions during tool initialization.
- **How to apply:** Use an LRU `SchemaCache` to avoid re-serializing and re-sending tool descriptions on every request. Implement Anthropic's `cache_control` headers so schemas are only parsed once per session by the LLM Provider.

### 3. Serverless Invocation & Streamable HTTP
To eliminate persistent server costs and avoid idle CPU overhead, MCP servers can be natively scaled down to zero.
- **How to apply:** Follow the SSE (Server-Sent Events) or HTTP chunked-encoding model. Instead of a long-lived process, tools can be triggered via HTTP routes or lambda-like handlers (e.g. `awslabs/mcp`).

### 4. Dynamic Context & "Pull" vs "Push"
MCP typically pushes context proactively. Serverless patterns prefer pulling only what is immediately required.
- **How to apply:** Resources and templates in MCP should return lightweight URIs or pagination cursors first, streaming the bulk payload only when requested.

# Implementation Task Plan

The following tasks are broken down with roughly equal difficulty to advance our infrastructure and optimizations natively.

- [ ] **Task 1: Complete the SchemaCache Implementation**
  - Ensure the `vox-mcp` crate caches all tool JSON schemas with LRU eviction.
  - Implement and verify the `prompt_caching` formatting for Anthropic / OpenAI.

- [ ] **Task 2: Native Tool Short-Circuit**
  - In `vox-mcp`, handle file tools (`read_file`, `write_file`) in-process for orchestrator agents without initiating a subprocess.
  - Enable and pass integration tests for `test_native_read_file_short_circuit`.

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement A2A (Agent-To-Agent) Connectionless Handoff**
  - Implement lightweight context handoff in the `vox-mcp` crate instead of routing through full prompt evaluation.
  - Minimize JSON payload size by transmitting diffs or delta states between agents.

- [ ] **Task 4: Setup Compiler-Driven Data Extraction (CI/CD)**
  - Add logic to the `vox check` command to emit training data JSONL.
  - Prepare a script to generate instruction-code pairs for model sync.

- [ ] **Task 5: Refine `check_search_index` in `vox-typeck`**
  - Implement the missing type-checking blocks for `SearchIndexDecl` to ensure database stability.
