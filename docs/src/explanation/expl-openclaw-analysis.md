# OpenClaw Competitive Analysis

> **Canonical definition (Vox docs):** OpenClaw is an **open-source TypeScript agent platform**—a self-hosted gateway connecting chat platforms to LLMs with local tool access. **ClawHub** denotes its public **skills marketplace** (community skill bundles and discovery). Vox does not ship OpenClaw; integration is via **`vox openclaw`** (CLI, feature **`ars`**) and **`vox_ars::OpenClawClient`**. The short glossary entry cross-links here as SSOT.

> **Status**: Research document — Feb 2026

> Compares the OpenClaw platform with Vox's agentic infrastructure to identify adoption opportunities and improvement areas.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an open-source autonomous AI agent platform (large public GitHub footprint) by Peter Steinberger, built in TypeScript. It is often described as a self-hosted "operating system for AI agents" — a hub-and-spoke gateway connecting chat platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage) to LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models) with full local tool access (shell, browser, files).

## Architectural Comparison

| Dimension | OpenClaw | Vox |
|---|---|---|
| **Core** | TypeScript agent runtime + gateway server | Rust compiler pipeline (Lexer→Parser→HIR→Typeck→Codegen) |
| **Agent Model** | Single autonomous agent, multi-channel | Multi-agent orchestrator with named roles |
| **Extensibility** | Skills (.md), Plugins (TS modules), Webhooks | MCP tools (Rust), `@mcp.tool` language decorators |
| **Memory** | File-first (daily logs + MEMORY.md), BM25+vector search | `ContextStore` (in-memory HashMap with TTL), `VoxDb` (SQLite/Turso) |
| **Communication** | Chat platforms → Gateway → Agent | A2A MessageBus (unicast/broadcast/multicast), Handoff Payloads |
| **Orchestration** | Single-agent with session isolation | File-affinity routing, scope guards, file locks, budget, heartbeat |
| **Runtime** | Node.js with WebSocket gateway | Actor model with Scheduler, Supervisor, mailboxes |
| **Protocol** | MCP client (connecting to external servers) | MCP server (exposing tools to external agents/IDEs) |

## What Vox Does Better

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Purpose-built orchestrator with 25+ modules: file-affinity routing, scope guards, file locks, budget management, heartbeat monitoring, continuation engine. OpenClaw is single-agent.

### 2. Agent-to-Agent Communication
A2A MessageBus: typed messages (PlanHandoff, ContextShare, TaskAssignment, StatusUpdate, CompletionNotice, ErrorReport), unicast/broadcast/multicast, per-agent inboxes, audit trail.

### 3. Structured Database
VoxDb wraps CodeStore with 25+ typed entry kinds, multi-backend (local SQLite, Turso cloud, embedded replica), transactions, retry logic.

### 4. Gamification Layer
Achievements, companions with moods, daily quests, bug battles, leaderboards, cost tracking, ASCII sprites — all in MCP response envelopes.

### 5. Language-Native MCP
`@mcp.tool` decorator compiles directly to MCP tool definitions from syntax. No glue code.

### 6. Actor-Based Runtime
Process spawning, supervisors, schedulers, subscription system, feedback loops for durable execution.

## What OpenClaw Does Better (Improvement Opportunities)

### 1. Persistent Memory System
- Daily append-only Markdown logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- Curated long-term knowledge (`MEMORY.md`)
- Pre-compaction memory flush (saves facts before summarization)
- BM25 + vector hybrid search (SQLite-vec + FTS5)
- Human-inspectable and editable

### 2. Context Window Management
- Automatic compaction (summarizes old turns)
- Context window guards (blocks runs with insufficient context)
- Head/tail preservation (keeps first/last of long messages)
- Turn-based trimming, `/compact` command

### 3. Session Lifecycle
- Persistent JSONL session files
- Session resolution and routing
- Session isolation as security boundaries
- Daily reset policies and cleanup

### 4. Skills Marketplace (ClawHub)
- Public registry with versioned skill bundles
- Vector-search discovery
- CLI install (`clawhub install <slug>`)
- Community ecosystem and network effects

### 5. Plugin System
- Channel plugins (new messaging platforms)
- Memory plugins (alternative storage backends)
- Tool plugins (custom capabilities)
- Provider plugins (custom LLM providers)
- Runtime hooks (event-driven automation)

### 6. Docker Sandboxing
- Tool execution inside Docker containers
- Configurable per-session sandboxing
- Dangerous path blocking (`/etc`, `/proc`)

### 7. Browser Automation
- Full CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) integration
- Isolated Chromium instances
- Form filling, scraping, screenshots, PDF export

### 8. Webhook Ingestion
- HTTP POST endpoints for external triggers
- Event-driven task creation from external systems

### 9. Cross-Channel Memory
- Shared workspace and memory across chat platforms
- Preferences established in one channel apply everywhere

### 10. Security Model
- Policy-as-code (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md)
- Prompt injection defenses
- Audit and session logging

## Native WS-First Interop Contract (Vox, 2026-03)

Vox now treats OpenClaw interoperability as a WS-first runtime contract, not only a skill import path:

- **Primary transport:** OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket protocol (`connect.challenge` event, `connect` request, request/response/event frames).
- **Secondary fallback:** OpenClaw HTTP compatibility surfaces where needed (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`) and existing skills endpoints.
- **Internal boundary:** `OpenClawRuntimeAdapter` in Rust (`vox-ars`) isolates wire protocol details from CLI/runtime consumers.
- **Script surface:** `.vox` gets a low-complexity builtin module (`OpenClaw.*`) that lowers into runtime helper calls and still passes normal parse/type/HIR gates.
- **Endpoint SSOT:** adapter resolution prefers explicit overrides, then env/Clavis, then upstream discovery (`/.well-known/openclaw.json`) with cached last-known-good fallback, then deterministic local defaults.
- **Packaging posture:** Vox bootstrap/upgrade can install a managed `openclaw-gateway` sidecar from release assets when present in `checksums.txt`, avoiding hardcoded URL catalogs.

### Security and policy posture

- Resolve auth through Clavis (`VOX_OPENCLAW_TOKEN`) where available.
- Keep TLS verification enabled by default.
- Prefer loopback/tailnet WS URLs in dev (`VOX_OPENCLAW_WS_URL`), with explicit token/pass-through for remote.
- Treat adapter errors as typed contract failures (transport/protocol/method) for deterministic script/CLI handling.

### Contract fixtures

Protocol fixtures are versioned in:

- `contracts/openclaw/protocol/connect.challenge.json`
- `contracts/openclaw/protocol/connect.hello-ok.json`
- `contracts/openclaw/protocol/subscriptions.list.response.json`
- `contracts/openclaw/discovery/well-known.response.json`
- `contracts/openclaw/discovery/well-known.minimal.json`

The CI guard `vox ci openclaw-contract` validates required fixture presence and baseline shape invariants.

Resolver and sidecar lifecycle SSOT: `docs/src/reference/openclaw-discovery-sidecar-ssot.md`.
