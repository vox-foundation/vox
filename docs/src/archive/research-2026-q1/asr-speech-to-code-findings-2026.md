# Vox Speech-to-Code Pipeline Research (April 2026)

## Executive Summary
This document synthesizes findings from 15+ comprehensive web evaluations targeting the optimal Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architecture for building a Vox "Speech-to-Code" pipeline in 2026. This research evaluates models under the specific constraints of local inference on an RTX 4080 Super (16GB VRAM), Rusty Candle compatibility, and the ability to process dense programming vocabulary (camelCase, identifiers, symbols).

For the 2026 landscape, the recommended architecture is a **Hybrid Streaming pipeline** that utilizes a low-latency model like **Moonshine** or **NVIDIA Parakeet TDT** for the real-time dictation interface, paired with **Faster-Whisper (Large-v3-turbo / QLoRA tuned)** for batch-processed syntax correction and post-processing.
If a single, locally deployed multi-modal architecture is preferred—especially one compatible with Vox's MENS ML strategy—**Canary Qwen 2.5B** offers a state-of-the-art Speech-Augmented Language Model (SALM) design that integrates ASR directly with an LLM decoder.

## 1. Benchmarking the Contenders (WER & RTF)

The landscape of ASR models has shifted significantly, emphasizing latency reduction (RTFx) and parameter efficiency.

### OpenAI Whisper (The Multi-lingual Baseline)
*   **Strengths:** Whisper remains the gold standard for zero-shot multilingual performance and out-of-the-box robustness.
*   **Performance:** Standard `Large-v3` achieves a WER of ~6.8%. However, evaluating execution directly on standard Python endpoints results in high latency due to batch processing constraints (30-second fixed input window padding).
*   **2026 Evolution:** The introduction of **Whisper Large-v3-turbo** drops decoder layers from 32 down to 4. When run via **Faster-Whisper** (CTranslate2, int8 quantization), we can achieve a 4-6x speedup (RTFx) over the baseline while maintaining a sub-7% WER. 
*   **VRAM:** The RTX 4080 Super (16GB) easily accommodates Faster-Whisper Large-v3-turbo (~6GB required) or even full Large-v3 (~10GB required).

### NVIDIA Canary Qwen 2.5B / Parakeet
NVIDIA has aggressively pushed the boundaries of streaming ASR.
*   **Parakeet TDT 1.1B:** Uses an ultra-optimized FastConformer encoder and a Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT). Rather than predicting blank spaces like standard RNN-Ts, TDT predicts tokens and durations jointly, skipping redundant compute. Real-Time Factor (RTFx) scales beyond 2,000x on modern GPUs.
*   **Canary Qwen (SALM):** Canary utilizes a FastConformer encoder attached directly to a frozen **Qwen 2.5B / 1.7B LLM decoder** via a linear projection adapter. It achieves top-tier English WER (~5.63%).
*   **Why it matters:** Unlike Whisper, Canary acts as a true SALM. The LLM decoder allows it to reason over what it hears. In a coding context, it can not only transcribe the audio but correctly infer programming syntax and formatting out-of-the-box because the text decoder is an LLM.

### Moonshine
*   **Streaming Native:** Moonshine uses Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) instead of Whisper's fixed positional embeddings. It does not pad audio to 30 seconds.
*   **Programming Latency:** For live dictation (e.g., GitHub Copilot Voice style interactions), Moonshine completely eclipses Whisper in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT), often hitting sub-150ms ranges locally, giving the user immediate, interactive feedback.

## 2. Coding Vocabulary & The WER Challenge

General ASR models struggle heavily with the semantic strictness of code. Traditional WER formulas (Substitutions + Deletions + Insertions / Total words) are overly punitive to symbols, `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and highly unique identifiers.

*   **The Problem:** Normalizing text strips punctuation, but in programming, punctuation is syntax. If the model mishears "dot property" as ".property", ASR evaluation might score it correct, but the compiler will fail if it mistypes a bracket. 
*   **The Adaptation Strategy (QLoRA):** The industry standard for 2026 is avoiding full fine-tuning. Because Vox utilizes the MENS training pipeline, we can leverage **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)** on the ASR decoder. By freezing the FastConformer/Whisper encoder and training a LoRA adapter on a dataset of synthetic audio dictating Rust/TypeScript code, the model learns the structural bias of our workspace.

## 3. Compatibility with Vox & Candle / Architecture Proposal

Vox favors Rust-native orchestration to avoid Python GIL constraints and deployment overhead. 
*   **Hugging Face Candle:** Candle natively supports Whisper and offers native CUDA bindings. It executes Whisper memory-efficiently directly on the RTX 4080.
*   **Integrating Canary/Qwen into Candle:** Moving Canary to Candle presents a slight engineering lift. Canary's architecture includes the `FastConformer` encoder, which is an NVIDIA NeMo primitive. To natively support Canary within the existing Whisper wrapper, Vox would need a Rust/Candle translation of the FastConformer block and the linear projection adapter that marries it to the Qwen text decoder.

### Proposed Architecture for the Vox Speech-to-Code Pipeline

1.  **The Fast Streaming Layer (Frontend):** 
    Implement a lightweight streaming model (e.g., **Moonshine** or **Vosk**) to handle immediate voice activity detection and sub-300ms interactive echo on the UI.
2.  **The Deep Decoding Layer (Backend):** 
    Pass the audio buffer to an integrated **Whisper Large-v3-Turbo** or **Canary Qwen** model running on the RTX 4080 Super backend. 
3.  **The MENS Adapter (Fine-tuning):**
    Expand the Vox MENS pipeline to train a Domain-Specific LoRA adapter. We feed synthetically generated audio of Vox codebase code alongside the actual code text through QLoRA, forcing the decoder to map generic phonetic sounds to Vox-specific Rust macros and Latin variables.

## Conclusion

For 2026, dropping in a raw `Whisper` model is insufficient for high-fidelity code dictation due to its batch-latency and generic vocabulary. 
**NVIDIA Canary Qwen** presents the strongest architectural foundation because it merges acoustic representation directly with an LLM’s reasoning, allowing for immediate syntax awareness. Alternatively, wrapping **Whisper Large-v3-turbo** in Faster-Whisper, executed via Candle, and bound to a custom code-LoRA adapter provides the most reliable open-source pathway with current Rust crate ecosystems.
