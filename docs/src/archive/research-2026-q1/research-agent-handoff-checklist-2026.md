**9\. Architecture Decision Checklist for Implementing Agent Handoff Continuity**

* \[ \] **Identity Provenance:** Are all inter-agent handoffs executed using an OBO (On-Behalf-Of) token flow that cryptographically preserves the original user session\_id?  
* \[ \] **State Isolation:** Have we eliminated the passing of full conversational transcripts between specialized agents to prevent context bleed and hallucinated consensus?  
* \[ \] **Evidence Transportation:** Are data payloads exceeding localized limits passed as secure, verifiable A2A Artifact URIs rather than inline message strings to ensure Opaque Execution?  
* \[ \] **Truncation Monitoring:** Is a telemetry layer actively asserting that LLM outputs do not contain stop\_reason=None and verifying that textual intent matches emitted tool payloads?  
* \[ \] **Unified Retrieval Policy:** Is the decision to retrieve context governed by a single, lightweight evaluator model (e.g., CRAG methodology) rather than duplicated across disparate tool definitions?  
* \[ \] **Asynchronous Compaction:** Is conversational history compacted by a background process (extracting structured facts to a vector store) rather than pausing the active user session for synchronous summarization?  
* \[ \] **Handoff Lifecycle Management:** Does every inter-agent transition utilize a stateful representation (e.g., SUBMITTED, WORKING, FAILED) to natively handle network timeouts, infinite loops, and deadlocks?
