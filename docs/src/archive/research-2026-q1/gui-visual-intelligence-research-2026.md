# GUI Visual Intelligence: Vox Visus (Voice of Vision)

*Research synthesis: April 2026*

This document covers the complete research landscape for adding dedicated, AI-native GUI visual analysis capabilities to Vox, including a taxonomy of GUI bugs, the hub-and-spoke architecture for image analysis, VLM selection, data flywheel design, and integration with Vox's TypeScript codegen and multi-framework emission targets.

## 1. Why LLMs Fail at Visual GUI Bugs (The Core Problem)

LLMs generating TypeScript/UI code are *logically correct* but visually blind. The root cause: code correctness and visual correctness are orthogonal problems.

Code passes type-check but the rendered output can have:
- Elements rendered on top of one another (stacking context traps).
- Clipped content hidden behind `overflow: hidden` boundaries.
- Hydration flash states from SSR/client divergence.
- Font weight/antialiasing discrepancies across browsers.
- Invisible click blockers (zero-opacity `div` covering interactive zone).

**No unit test or type checker catches these.** Only a visual oracle can.

### The "Logically Correct, Visually Broken" Failure Class

| Code Property | Passes? | Visual State |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript compiles | ✅ | Element clipped behind sibling |
| React renders | ✅ | Modal blocked by transformed parent |
| Functional test passes | ✅ | Button unclickable (transparent overlay) |
| Accessibility audit passes | ✅ | Text contrast fails at certain bg color |
| Hydration succeeds | ✅ | Layout shift flash on first paint |

This class of failure is the primary target audience for the image analysis lane.

## 2. Comprehensive GUI Bug Taxonomy

### 2.1 Layout & Stacking Bugs

**Z-Index Stacking Context Traps** (most common, hardest for LLMs to predict)
- Root cause: Any CSS property that creates a new stacking context traps all children within it, making `z-index: 9999` useless even in theory.
- CSS triggers: `opacity < 1`, `transform` (even `translateZ(0)`), `filter`, `backdrop-filter`, `clip-path`, `isolation: isolate`, `will-change`, `mix-blend-mode`.
- Vox-specific risk: When Vox emits `position: relative` + animation `transform` on a wrapper component, any portals or modals emitted as children of that wrapper become visually trapped.
- **Fix pattern:** React Portals (`ReactDOM.createPortal`) must be used for all overlays, tooltips, modals, and toasts. Vox codegen must emit portals for these component types automatically.

**Overflow Clipping**
- Parent has `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: clip`; child content extends beyond parent boundary and is silently cut off.
- Common when Vox emits percentage-width + fixed-height containers.
- Detection method: Check child bounding rect extends beyond parent bounding rect.

**Invisible Click Blockers**
- A `position: absolute` or `position: fixed` element with zero (or near-zero) opacity sits on top of an interactive element, absorbing pointer events.
- Difficult to detect visually (element appears clickable). AXTree analysis required.
- Common origin: animation cleanup leaving a ghost layer.

**Negative Margin Overlap**
- Negative margin pulls element visually outside its flow position, overlapping adjacent elements.
- Entirely invisible to unit tests.

### 2.2 Hydration & SSR Mismatch Bugs (Vox → NextJS / RSC targets)

When Vox emits TypeScript targeting Next.js App Router, React Server Components, or Edge SSR:

**Hydration Mismatch Flash**
- Server renders one DOM structure; client React reconciler produces a different structure → visual flash/layout shift while React corrects the DOM.
- Root causes: `Math.random()` / `Date.now()` in render, environment-specific APIs (`window`, `localStorage`), timezone/locale differences between server and client, invalid HTML nesting (browser auto-corrects inconsistently).
- Vox check: Audit emitted TypeScript for direct `window`/`document` access outside `useEffect` in SSR-eligible components.

**CSS-in-JS FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content)**
- When style injection is deferred until JS hydration, the page briefly renders without styles.
- Relevant when Vox emits CSS-in-JS patterns rather than static CSS classes.

**Dynamic Import Visual Shift**
- Components loaded with `next/dynamic` cause layout shift holes while the chunk loads.
- Vox codegen should emit appropriate `loading` skeletons for lazy-loaded components.

### 2.3 Cross-Browser Rendering Discrepancies

**Font Rendering Divergence**
- Safari (WebKit) renders certain font weights differently (typically bolder) vs. Chrome/Firefox.
- Variable fonts exhibit inconsistencies without explicit `@font-face` range declarations.
- `font-synthesis: none` prevents faux-bold/italic that breaks typography.
- Windows vs. macOS font hinting causes sub-pixel rendering differences that defeat pixel-perfect VRTs.

**CSS Property Support Gaps**
- `backdrop-filter` has lagged Safari support edge cases.
- Container queries have varying fallback behavior.
- Scroll-timeline / view-timeline CSS animations are Blink-only as of early 2026.

**Flexbox / Grid Edge Cases**
- Min-content, max-content, intrinsic sizing behavior differs subtly across browsers.
- Safari flex gap behavior on older iOS (common in MUD mobile clients).

### 2.4 Accessibility Visual Bugs

**Contrast Ratio Failures**
- WCAG 2.1 AA: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text.
- Common failure: Vox dark-mode token generation produces colors that pass in one theme but fail in another.
- AI can detect these via color extraction from screenshots; automated tools (axe-core) catch these deterministically.

**Focus Ring Invisible**
- `outline: none` suppression without providing custom focus styles leaves keyboard users with no visual indicator.
- Focus rings can be hidden by overflow clipping or stacking context.

**Text Truncation Without Tooltip**
- Dynamic data renders text longer than the container; `text-overflow: ellipsis` clips it; no title/tooltip provides the full content.
- AI vision models can detect this by comparing text in DOM vs. visible area.

### 2.5 Animation & Transitions

**Animation Left-State Bugs**
- CSS animation `fill-mode: forwards` leaves the element in the animated end-state permanently, which may conflict with later style updates.
- Transitions that fire before layout is complete cause visible jumps.

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
- Images without explicit dimensions cause reflow when they load, shifting surrounding content.
- Late-loading web fonts cause FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text).

### 2.6 Interactive State Bugs

**Disabled State Confusion**
- Button appears visually active (no `disabled` styling applied) but has `pointer-events: none`, blocking interaction.
- Opposite: button appears disabled visually but `disabled` prop not propagated into the DOM.

**Loading State Race Conditions**
- Skeleton placeholder and real content both visible simultaneously during render.
- Spinner remains visible after data load due to missed state transition.

## 3. Hub-and-Spoke Image Analysis Architecture

### 3.1 Core Design Philosophy

Like the Research lane and the Agents lane, the **Image Analysis lane must be isolated architecturally** from the text-only inference pipeline. This is non-negotiable for three reasons:

1. **Token Budget Isolation:** High-resolution screenshots generate thousands of visual tokens. Leaking these into a text-only session exhausts the context window and degrades text reasoning quality.
2. **Model Specialization:** The optimal model for image analysis (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL, or a domain-finetuned VLM) is different from the optimal model for code generation or orchestration reasoning. Each lane should route to its best model.
3. **Latency & Cost SLOs:** Image analysis is expensive. Running it synchronously inside a code-gen session would make every request slow. It must be async/deferred.

### 3.2 The Hub-and-Spoke Model

```

```

### 3.3 Image Analysis Lane Responsibilities

| Sub-Task | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Screenshot capture | URL / DOM state | Raw PNG (1x, 2x DevicePixelRatio) |
| AXTree extraction | Playwright CDP | Compact JSON: roles, labels, bounding boxes |
| Bug annotation | Screenshot + AXTree | Bug report JSON (category, element, coords, severity) |
| Visual regression diff | Golden baseline + current screenshot | Diff image + delta score |
| Contractor feedback | Bug report JSON | Structured CLI-presentable report |

### 3.4 Payload Construction (Hybrid Input Strategy)

Research confirms that VLMs perform significantly better with both visual and structural inputs. The canonical payload for the image analysis request:

```jsonc
{
  "task": "gui_audit",
  "image": {
    "type": "base64_png",
    "data": "<...>",
    "width": 1280,
    "height": 800,
    "device_pixel_ratio": 2
  },
  "accessibility_tree": {
    "compact": true,
    "include_roles": ["button", "input", "link", "dialog", "alert"],
    "bounding_boxes": true,
    "max_depth": 8
  },
  "dom_hints": {
    "framework": "react",
    "emit_target": "nextjs_app_router",
    "source_map_available": true
  },
  "rubric": "contracts/eval/gui_visual_rubric.v1.schema.json"
}
```

**Key rule:** Raw image data MUST NOT be injected into the text-only lane or the planning/reasoning context. It flows exclusively through the image analysis lane.

### 3.5 Vision Model Selection (2026 State)

| Model | Strengths | Weaknesses | Vox Fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Qwen2.5-VL** | Open-source, strong GUI grounding, absolute coordinate output, fine-tunable | Needs local GPU (≥16GB VRAM for 7B) | Best for self-hosted MENS integration |
| **Gemini 2.0 Pro (Vision)** | Native Google infra, excellent screenshot understanding, large context | API cost, privacy constraints | Best for cloud/remote call tier |
| **GPT-4o Vision** | Strong reasoning + vision, good for complex layout understanding | Cost, API dependency | Fallback for complex reasoning |
| **Claude Sonnet (Vision)** | Strong multi-turn visual analysis, good at structured outputs | Less specialized for fine UI coordinates | Good for bug report generation |

**Recommendation for Vox:** Route-based:
- **Self-hosted MENS path:** Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B via Populi GPU mesh for screenshot scanning.
- **Remote cloud path:** Gemini Vision Pro for complex, multi-screen analysis requirements.
- **Selection logic:** Use capability registry (`vox-capability-registry`) to gate which path is active based on `$VOX_VLM_LANE`.

## 4. Automated Continuous GUI Feedback System

### 4.1 The Testing Flywheel Architecture

```
Generate UI code (Vox → TypeScript)
         ↓
Render in headless browser (Playwright)
         ↓
Capture multi-viewport screenshots (mobile, tablet, desktop)
         ↓
Extract AXTree (Chrome DevTools Protocol)
         ↓
[IMAGE ANALYSIS LANE] → VLM audit request
         ↓
Structured bug report → CI fail / PR annotation
         ↓
Developer fixes + feedback annotation
         ↓
Annotated pair → MENS training corpus (gui-vision lane)
         ↓
Fine-tune VLM → improved GUI audit accuracy
         ↓ (loop)
```

### 4.2 Three Layers of Detection

**Layer 1: Deterministic (Zero False Positives)**
Run before VLM to catch structurally verifiable bugs:
- `getBoundingClientRect()` overlap detection for sibling elements.
- Contrast ratio computation from extracted colors (axe-core).
- Bounding box containment check: child rect vs. parent overflow rect.
- Hydration error interception from browser console.

**Layer 2: Visual Regression (Screenshot Diff)**
- Store golden baselines in version control (or Arca-backed blob storage).
- On each PR: render + capture; compute pixel diff using `odiff` (fast native diff).
- Flag as regression if delta > threshold (suggested: 0.2% pixel change).
- Gate: pass baseline diff to VLM only if pixel delta > threshold (cost optimization).

**Layer 3: VLM Semantic Analysis (Catches the Rest)**
- Send screenshot + AXTree to the image analysis lane.
- Structured prompt (few-shot): classify bugs into taxonomy categories.
- Output: JSON array of `{ category, element_selector, coordinates, severity, description }`.
- Post-process through `vision_rubric.v1.schema.json` (already defined in this repo).

### 4.3 Prompt Engineering for GUI Bug Detection (Few-Shot)

Structure the VLM prompt in four parts:

```
GOAL: Identify all visual bugs in this UI screenshot based on the provided rubric.
Classify each bug using the taxonomy: [overlap | clip | contrast | hydration | truncation | invisible_blocker | layout_shift | cross_browser].

RULES:
- Only report bugs that a user would notice or that would impair interaction.
- Do NOT report intentional design choices (partial disclosure patterns, etc.).
- Provide pixel coordinates for each finding.
- Output MUST be valid JSON matching the schema at end of prompt.

CONTEXT:
<accessibility_tree_json>
Framework: React / Next.js App Router
Emit source: Vox compiler v0.x

SCREENSHOT: <image>

OUTPUT SCHEMA:
{ "bugs": [{ "category": "...", "severity": "high|medium|low", "coordinates": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 0, "h": 0 }, "description": "..." }] }
```

**Key prompt engineering rules:**
- Provide the AXTree as compact JSON to reduce token usage.
- Use few-shot examples of known-good vs. known-bad states from the existing Vox test corpus.
- Force JSON output with constrained schema to enable programmatic consumption.
- Run the same screenshot through two models; aggregate results to reduce false positives.

### 4.4 Multi-Viewport Strategy

Each render captured at:
- `375×812` (iPhone SE, mobile breakpoint)
- `768×1024` (iPad, tablet breakpoint)
- `1280×800` (laptop, desktop breakpoint)
- `1920×1080` (large desktop)

Bug classes to cross-check across viewports:
- Overflow: often only visible at mobile width.
- Truncation: occurs at narrow widths only.
- Contrast: often breaks in dark mode which may be viewport-independent.
- Overlap: can appear only at specific layout breakpoints.

## 5. Vox-Specific Risks from TypeScript Codegen

### 5.1 Stacking Context from Emitted Animation Wrappers

When Vox emits CSS animations or transition wrappers, it may silently create a new stacking context. Example:

```typescript
// Vox-emitted transition wrapper (risky pattern)
<div style={{ transform: 'translateZ(0)', opacity: fadeIn ? 1 : 0 }}>
  <Modal /> {/* This modal is now TRAPPED in the parent's stacking context */}
</div>
```

**Codegen rule:** Any Vox-emitted wrapper that uses `transform`, `opacity`, `will-change`, or `filter` MUST emit a lint annotation warning if the component tree contains overlay/modal/tooltip descendants.

### 5.2 Portal Non-Emission for Overlay Components

Vox's compiler must classify component intent. Components with semantics of `Modal`, `Tooltip`, `Dropdown`, `Toast`, `Popover` and `Drawer` MUST be emitted using `ReactDOM.createPortal(children, document.body)`. Failure to do so causes the stacking context trap described above.

### 5.3 Missing `key` Props on Dynamic Lists

React reconciliation relies on stable `key` props. Vox-emitted list rendering without stable keys causes:
- Ghost renders (element re-mounts instead of updates).
- Visual "flicker" on list updates.
- Animation state resets on re-renders.

### 5.4 Server Component vs. Client Component Boundary Leaks

When Vox emits Next.js RSC-targeting code:
- Components that use `useState`, `useEffect`, browser APIs must be tagged `"use client"`.
- Missing boundary tags cause SSR → hydration divergence → visual flash.
- Vox compiler should enforce `"use client"` emission for hooks and browser-API-dependent components.

### 5.5 CSS Variable Scope Pollution

Vox emitting CSS variables at `:root` scope with generic names can collide with host framework CSS (Tailwind, Material UI, Chakra UI) causing:
- Color tokens overriding host theme unexpectedly.
- Font family variables overriding framework defaults.

**Mitigation:** Namespace all Vox-emitted CSS variables with a `--vox-` prefix.

### Wave 2: VLM Integration
- [ ] Wire Qwen3.5-VL as the MENS self-hosted vision lane model.
- [ ] Implement hybrid payload builder (screenshot + AXTree compact JSON).
- [ ] Add few-shot prompt template for GUI bug classification.
- [ ] Store bug reports in Arca (`ops_vision_audits.rs` in vox-db).

### Wave 3: CI/CD Integration & Flywheel
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions step: `vox visus audit` on every PR.
- [ ] Implement golden baseline management (`vox visus baseline update`).
- [ ] Wire bug report annotations back into MENS training corpus (gui-vision lane).
- [ ] Add `vox visus diff` command for interactive baseline comparison.

### Wave 4: Multi-Framework & Cross-Browser Coverage
- [ ] Add multi-viewport capture scaffolding (4 breakpoints).
- [ ] Add Safari/Firefox rendering via Playwright cross-browser mode.
- [ ] Fine-tune Qwen3.5-VL on accumulated Vox-specific GUI bug examples.
