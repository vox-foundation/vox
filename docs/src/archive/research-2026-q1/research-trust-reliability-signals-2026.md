# Architectural Reliability in Agentic AI Orchestration

## 1. Context & Analyzed Systems
Evaluation of statistical mechanisms within the multi-agent Trust Orchestration Layer:
- **Trust Rollup:** Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) with a fixed alpha.
- **Small-Sample Smoothing:** Laplace Smoothing (uniform prior) for sparse task data.
- **Factuality Gate (Socrates):** Natural Language Inference (NLI) contradiction rates.
- **Fatigue Penalty:** Context and attention-budget exhaustion penalties.

## 2. Empirical Findings & Failure Modes

### EWMA tracking failure in non-stationary environments
- EWMA with fixed alpha assumes stationarity. LLM agent performance is non-stationary (subject to API drift, prompt distribution changes).
- **Detection Lag:** Takes too long to register performance degradation.
- **Variance Blindness:** Routes based on a point-estimate scalar without modeling variance; treats wildly volatile agents and stable average agents identically.

### Laplace Smoothing (Uniform Priors) punishes specialization
- Laplace smoothing mathematically enforces a Beta(1,1) uniform prior (asserts all new agents have a 50% baseline success rate).
- Empirical reality: specialized agents have highly skewed distributions (e.g., highly competent in logic, incompetent in image parsing).
- Throttles the routing momentum of highly competent agents when sample sizes are small.

### Factuality Gating via NLI confounds abstract synthesis
- NLI evaluates semantic contradiction but is extremely vulnerable to structural noise and paraphrasing.
- State-of-the-art models engaged in advanced abstract synthesis frequently trigger false "contradictions" simply due to lexical divergence.
- Penalizing this causes the "Coverage Paradox," wherein agents adapt to a conservative "refusal loop" to avoid penalties.

### "Winner-Takes-All" (WTA) Routing Collapse
- Transmitting raw point-estimate trust scores to a greedy routing logic forces a devastating feedback loop.
- One agent secures early success, monopolizes task allocation, and drops its statistical variance. Peer agents are starved of data and anchored to low artificial priors. 
- Results in topological fragility and uncalibrated failover risk during sudden upstream degradation.

## 3. Validated Architectural Adjustments

1. **Deprecate EWMA for Bayesian Tracking:** Implement lightweight Unscented/Extended Kalman Filters (UKF/EKF) to dynamically adjust to drift and calculate variance/confidence intervals for intelligent routing.
2. **Empirical Bayes over Laplace Processing:** Calculate the global system $\alpha$ and $\beta$ variables dynamically via Method of Moments. Use these data-driven distributions as agent priors, removing the 50% penalty bias.
3. **Deploy UCB / Boltzmann Routing:** Separate exploitation from exploration. Use epsilon-greedy or Upper Confidence Bound strategies to probabilitistically route to low-trust agents to prevent WTA topological collapse.
4. **Gate the Socrates Gate:** Pair the NLI contradiction penalty heavily with a coverage metric to preserve highly abstract multi-hop synthesis capabilities. 

*Note: The system's penalty for "attention fatigue" is highly supported by LLM "Context Rot" literature (mathematical zero-sum softmax exhaustion).*
