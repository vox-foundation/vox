# Language Alias Canonicalization for LLM Target Languages

*Status: Research / Findings*
*Synthesis of LLM probability mass behavior and K-complexity impact as of April 2026.*

## Executive Summary

When designing a programming language, it is a common human-centric reflex to introduce aliases or synonymous syntax (macros, shorthand) for core language primitives. The intuition is that offering multiple ways to express the same concept provides flexibility for the developer. Furthermore, one might hypothesize that providing multiple valid syntactic options increases the number of "valid outputs" an LLM can produce, theoretically making it "easier" for the model to stumble upon a correct answer.

However, empirical evidence in LLM training and inference strongly contradicts this hypothesis. **For AI-native languages like Vox, syntactic aliases do not increase the likelihood of correct generation; they act as a "split-brain" penalty that diffuses probability mass, increases Kolmogorov complexity (K-complexity), and drastically raises the hallucination rate.**

The architectural conclusion for Vox is absolute strict canonicalization: there must be exactly **one** right way to express a core semantic concept.

## The "Split-Brain" Probability Mass Problem

Autoregressive Language Models (like Qwen, Llama, and Claude) generate code by predicting the next token based on a probability distribution derived from their training corpus.

### Human Analogy vs. Machine Reality
If a language has two valid keywords for return—`return` and `ret`—a human developer picks one based on personal preference and moves on. The human's cognitive load is unaffected by the existence of the other keyword.

For an LLM, the existence of both `return` and `ret` in the training data means the model must allocate its probability mass (which always sums to 1.0) between both valid tokens at every exit point of a function.
- **Scenario A (Canonical):** Only `return` exists. $P(\text{return}) = 0.98$. The model generates `return` with high confidence.
- **Scenario B (Aliased):** Both `return` and `ret` exist. $P(\text{return}) = 0.55$, $P(\text{ret}) = 0.40$. 

In Scenario B, the model's confidence in *either* correct token is weakened. This weakened confidence leaves room for "noise" tokens (hallucinations, unrelated symbols) to rise in relative probability, leading to syntax errors or illegal state generation.

## Impact on K-Complexity and Tokenizer Fragmentation

As established in [Vox LLM-Native Language Research](vox-llm-native-language-research-2026.md) and [Zero-Shot Invariants](research-ts-hallucination-zero-shot-invariants-2026.md), reducing K-complexity is the primary defense against LLM hallucination.

Aliases inflate K-complexity in two ways:
1. **Contextual Ambiguity:** The model must use precious attention-head capacity to determine *which* alias contextually fits best (e.g., "Am I mimicking a legacy style that uses `ret` or a modern style that uses `return`?"). This is wasted compute that should be spent on business logic.
2. **Tokenizer Fertility:** Aliases are often abbreviations (`ret`, `!=`, `dec`). Because they are less common in generalized training data than their fully-spelled or phonetic counterparts (`return`, `not is`), they frequently fragment into multiple subword tokens (e.g., `re` + `t`). As analyzed in the recent [Language Surface Audit](vox-language-surface-audit-2026.md), replacing a 1-token canonical keyword with a 2-token alias physically elongates the program context.

## Specific Canonicalization Mandates in Vox

Based on these findings, Vox has adopted a strict policy of retiring aliases in favor of a single, phonetically distinct canonical surface.

### 1. `ret` vs `return`
- **Finding:** `ret` was originally introduced as a shorter alias to save characters. However, it costs *more* tokens than `return` in most modern BPE tokenizers.
- **Resolution:** `ret` is strictly deprecated. `return` is the sole canonical keyword.

### 2. `==` / `!=` vs `is` / `isnt`
- **Finding:** Maintaining both symbolic (`==`) and phonetic (`is`) equality operators splits the training data exactly in half.
- **Resolution:** The language must canonicalize to a single phonetic representation (`is`). The contraction `isnt` is also retired because it is an unusual English contraction that fragments during tokenization. Inequality is canonicalized to `not (x is y)` or the universally recognized `!=` (pending final syntax freeze).

### 3. `->` vs `to` for Return Types
- **Finding:** Using both `fn main() -> int` and `fn main() to int` creates structural ambiguity for the parser and the LLM.
- **Resolution:** Canonicalize to `to` as the 1-token phonetic standard.

## Conclusion

Providing an LLM with "multiple valid ways to be right" actually creates **multiple opportunities for the model to be uncertain**.

By aggressively collapsing aliases, macros, and syntactic sugar into single, canonical representations, the Vox compiler removes decision trees from the LLM's autoregressive generation path. This forces the probability distribution to "spike" on the canonical token, resulting in highly deterministic, reliable code generation.
