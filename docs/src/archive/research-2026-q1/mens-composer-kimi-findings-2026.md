# MENS findings: Composer and Kimi (2026)

This note records what is currently verifiable about Composer 2 and Kimi, with strict evidence classes and explicit unknowns. It is written for MENS planning under a local-first baseline (RTX 4080 Super) with additive cloud/distributed support.

## Evidence classes

- `primary`: first-party artifacts (official blog/docs/model cards/license text/repo artifacts).
- `secondary`: reputable reporting or analysis that cites primary signals but is not itself canonical source text.
- `inferred`: operational inference drawn from available facts; useful for planning, not proof.

## Revalidated claim table

| Claim | Source class | Evidence strength | Knownable now | Explicit unknowns | Operational impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cursor launched Composer 2 with published benchmark and pricing claims. | `primary` | High | Yes | None material. | Treat Composer launch claims as factual market signal; do not treat as architecture proof. |
| Launch materials describe continued pretraining + RL style improvements without explicit Kimi attribution in launch copy. | `primary` | High | Yes | Private training recipe details. | Keep attribution/provenance explicit in MENS docs to avoid ambiguity post-launch. |
| Kimi K2/K2.5 are public open-weight MoE family releases with published architecture framing and large-context positioning. | `primary` | High | Yes | Internal training data mix and private infrastructure details. | Transfer process patterns (data, eval, orchestration), not scale assumptions. |
| Kimi license text includes attribution-oriented clause for very large commercial products. | `primary` | High | Yes | Enforcement interpretation in edge legal scenarios. | Preserve lineage/attribution fields through contracts/manifests/adapters. |
| Post-launch statements indicate Composer 2 used a Kimi-derived base plus additional training. | `secondary` | Medium | Partially | Exact checkpoint lineage proportions, legal terms, and contract scope wording. | Use confidence labels in docs and avoid over-asserting unverified internals. |
| Public narrative frames relationship as authorized/commercially arranged via partner infrastructure. | `secondary` | Medium | Partially | Full agreement mechanics, contractual obligations beyond public statements. | Keep MENS compliance-ready while avoiding unsupported legal claims. |

## Tooling access constraint (important)

Direct machine retrieval of some social-post evidence remains inconsistent in our automation path. Claims whose strongest artifacts are social threads must remain `secondary` unless mirrored by durable primary records.

## Knownables vs unknowns

### Knownables

- Process-level overlap is plausible and public: continued pretraining plus RL/tool-task specialization.
- Kimi publicly emphasizes agentic/tooling outcomes, not only static benchmark deltas.
- MENS already has implementation points for safe adoption: provenance metadata, trajectory weighting, routing hints, and Populi visibility.

### Unknowns

- Exact weight lineage ratio between any Composer checkpoint and any Kimi checkpoint.
- Internal reward-model details, replay policy, filtering heuristics, and curation pipelines.
- Any strict architectural derivation claim at byte-level or kernel-level.

## Planning guidance for MENS

- Prefer process transfer over parameter transfer for 4080-class local training.
- Keep local QLoRA baseline stable; treat cloud/distributed paths as additive.
- Require explicit provenance fields anywhere artifacts are promoted, merged, or distributed.
- Apply confidence labels in architecture docs when facts are mixed primary/secondary.

## 2026 forward (structure and training)

- **Data**: tighten tool-trace and failure/recovery slices in the corpus mix (weights in `mens/config/mix.yaml`); strict operator mix + per-source reports reduce silent starvation when a JSONL is missing.
- **Eval**: add tiered held-out checks (unit parity tests today; extend toward long-horizon agent tasks only when compute allows — Kimi-style swarm/PARL is not a 4080 QLoRA default).
- **Manifests**: keep `training_manifest.json` and `populi_adapter_manifest_v3.json` as the promotion gate for lineage; avoid “hero” adapter drops without upstream ids.
- **MoE / trillion-parameter assumptions**: out of scope for the local Candle trainer; absorb any external MoE bases only through **documented** HF ids + provenance fields, not by pretending in-tree graphs match their block structure.
