**8\. Design Pattern Recommendations for Platform Gaps**

To resolve the orchestration platform's specific identified vulnerabilities, the following architectural design patterns must be adopted.  
**Gap 1: Remote relay ordering hazard**

* **Pattern: Deferred Artifact Resolution via A2A.** Do not send raw retrieval context over the wire to remote workers simultaneously with the task request. Instead, the orchestrator must generate the context locally, store it in a durable cache, and pass an A2A Artifact Reference (URI) to the remote agent. The remote agent's execution is suspended in a WORKING state until it successfully pulls and validates the context payload via the URI, eliminating asynchronous race conditions and enforcing opaque execution.

**Gap 2: Handoff continuity gap**

* **Pattern: Opaque Execution with Cryptographic Context IDs.** Abandon framework-specific memory sharing (e.g., passing raw state dictionaries between agents). Adopt the A2A protocol's Context and Task identifiers. When an agent hands off a task, it passes a globally unique thread\_id bundled with an On-Behalf-Of (OBO) JWT token. The receiving agent uses this ID to fetch only the approved, compacted subset of evidence required for its specific role, guaranteeing session identity preservation across vendor and framework boundaries.

**Gap 3: Policy duplication**

* **Pattern: Unified CRAG Router Gateway.** Strip retrieval trigger logic out of the individual MCP tools and the disparate orchestrator scripts. Implement a centralized routing gateway leveraging the Adaptive-RAG/CRAG methodology. Every query passes through a low-latency evaluator (e.g., a sub-1B parameter model) that definitively routes the request to: (A) Direct LLM generation (Trust Memory), (B) Targeted vector retrieval, or (C) Web search fallback. This ensures a consistent, global policy for knowledge ingestion.

**Gap 4: Compaction surface ambiguity**

* **Pattern: Proactive Asynchronous Hierarchical Memory.** Implement an architecture modeled on MemoryOS or A-MEM. Define a strictly separated "Short-Term Memory" (STM) buffer that only holds the immediate active turn. Assign a background asynchronous process to continuously distill the STM into structured, semantic key-value pairs stored in the Qdrant long-term memory graph. The orchestrator never handles raw conversation compaction synchronously; it simply queries the hierarchical memory API for relevant state on session initialization, preventing silent truncation.
