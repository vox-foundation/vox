**2\. Documented Failure Modes: Context Bleed and Session Identity Confusion**

*Evidence Quality Rating: High (Sourced from large-scale trace analyses, including the UC Berkeley MAST taxonomy encompassing over 1,600 production traces, and verified enterprise post-mortems).*  
As orchestration shifts from isolated chatbots to swarms of specialized workers, the boundaries between agent states become critical fault lines. Multi-agent systems fail differently from traditional software; they fail silently. An agent may complete a workflow and return a response that appears syntactically correct, only for downstream consequences to reveal a deep contextual corruption hours later.32

### **2.1 The "Context Bleed" Phenomenon**

Context bleed occurs when one agent's state or conversational history contaminates another's reasoning process.4 In multi-agent pipelines, if the orchestrator passes the full accumulated state into every sub-agent call, the context window rapidly bloats with irrelevant history.  
A documented production post-mortem in an e-commerce deployment illustrates this hazard. The system featured three specialized agents (inventory monitoring, automated purchase orders, supplier email coordination) managed by one orchestrator. After 48 hours of continuous operation, the orchestrator's failure to isolate state resulted in context bleed. The inventory agent began "remembering" supplier email conversations from three days prior, treating that stale data as active parameters, and making entirely hallucinated logistical decisions.3  
The diagnostic reality is that frontier models are highly optimized to pattern-match against provided data; they are fundamentally poor at ignoring irrelevant, deeply buried context.3 The injection of raw tool outputs meant for an execution agent into the context window of a planning agent poisons the planner's reasoning capabilities, compounding noise at every node in the agent network.4

### **2.2 Session Identity Smuggling and Confusion**

Without cryptographically bound session identifiers (session\_id, thread\_id) passed explicitly between handoffs, Multi-Agent Orchestration (MAO) systems suffer from identity confusion. The UC Berkeley MAST (Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy) study identified 14 unique failure modes across 1000+ annotated traces, noting that inter-agent misalignment and task verification failures account for a vast majority of system breakdowns, with overarching failure rates reaching as high as 86.7% in unoptimized deployments.4

* **Identity Smuggling and Governance Bypasses:** In decentralized environments, a compromised or hallucinating agent can bypass authorization by dropping or spoofing the session context. If Agent A calls Agent B using a generic service account or client\_credentials, Agent B only sees "Agent A is calling me." It cannot enforce user-specific policies or audit who actually requested the action. Without end-to-end identity provenance, an agent executing a database query cannot be traced back to the original user intent, violating enterprise auditing requirements and creating severe compliance blind spots.34  
* **The Infinite Loop ("Mirror Mirror"):** Initiated by directive misalignment, two agents with slightly conflicting system prompts (e.g., an Editor enforcing "professional tone" vs. a Writer enforcing "casual tone") reject each other's outputs endlessly. Because neither has the authority to override the other, and because there is no persistent session identifier tracking iteration counts to enforce a timeout or escalation, the system enters a recursive handoff cycle, exhausting API budgets autonomously.36  
* **Hallucinated Consensus:** When session state is merged improperly, agents can converge on a fabricated data point. A researcher agent may hallucinate a statistical metric. Because the session lacks strict provenance tagging, downstream analyst or coder agents adopt the hallucination as verified fact, creating a dangerous feedback loop of artificial confidence that bypasses traditional validation checks.36

The literature emphasizes that these failures are not model deficits, but engineering deficits. Addressing context bleed requires "surgical context injection," where subagents are treated as stateless endpoints receiving only specific task definitions and structured JSON snapshots of current world states, rather than full conversational histories.3
