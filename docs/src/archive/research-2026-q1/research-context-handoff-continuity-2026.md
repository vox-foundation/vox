# Agent Handoff Continuity & Context Compaction

## 1. Context
Evaluation of multi-agent orchestration architecture involving conversation history compaction, state sharing across agent invocations, and dynamic retrieval constraints.

## 2. Empirical Findings & Failure Modes

### Silent Context Truncation
- Compaction surfaces (like flat files or raw buffers) that rely on arbitrary line/byte limits result in silent truncation. Foundational prompt instructions and constraints are quietly evicted.
- **Fail Mode:** Agents confidently output incorrect results because they lack awareness their initialization logic was dropped.

### Context Bleed in Multi-Agent Handoffs
- Passing the full conversational history of Agent A into Agent B pollutes Agent B's reasoning context.
- **Fail Mode:** Planner agents hallucinate logic derived from the raw tool outputs of downstream worker agents.

### Identity Smuggling & Infinite Loops
- Lacking cryptographically tied session boundaries (thread_id) across handoffs causes identity confusion.
- **Fail Mode:** Agents enter infinite cycles of output rejection ("Mirror Mirror" loop) or assume authority levels of upstream callers improperly.

### Naive RAG Attention Dilution
- Hardcoding "always retrieve" policies across tool suites floods context windows with tangentially related chunks ("hard distractors"), diluting attention and burning budget.

## 3. Validated Architectural Adjustments

1. **Opaque Execution (A2A Protocol):** Implement Agent-to-Agent opaque execution. Do not pass conversational transcripts across boundaries. Pass strictly scoped Task definitions, and leverage secure URI "Artifacts" for large data transmission.
2. **On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Token Binding:** Enforce cryptographic provenance by attaching user-scoped OBO tokens and unique Thread IDs to every agent handoff.
3. **Unified CRAG Gateway:** Strip generic RAG triggers. Deploy Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CRAG) via a lightweight evaluator model to dynamically route requests between Trust Memory, Vector Retrieval, or Web searches.
4. **Asynchronous Memory Distillation:** Separate active turns (Short-Term Memory) from durational persistence. Dedicate an async background worker to extract semantic key-value relationships from the transcript into a Graph/Vector store, preventing silent rolling truncation.
