# Empirical Justification for Reward Weight Allocations in Code RL

The Vox MENS system stipulates a static reward allocation of 0.6 / 0.3 / 0.1 for syntax, unit tests, and coverage, respectively. The empirical literature surrounding state-of-the-art code generation RL systems—including AlphaCode 2, DeepSeek-Coder-V2, CodeRL, and PPOCoder—provides no evidence base for this specific allocation, and in fact, strongly advises against static, linear scalarization heavily weighted toward low-level syntactic proxies.

### The Fallacy of Static Linear Scalarization

Assigning a fixed, dominant weight of 60% to a prerequisite condition (syntactic correctness) fundamentally misunderstands the mechanics of the reinforcement learning value function. In contemporary RL post-training for code generation, syntactic correctness is rarely treated as an additive component of a linear reward equation. Instead, it is treated as a *gating mechanism* (a boolean multiplier) or is implicitly trained out of the model during a massive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) phase prior to the initiation of the RL loop.44

If a reward function is mathematically structured as an additive sum ($R = 0.6S + 0.3T + 0.1C$), the gradient landscape becomes highly distorted. A generated program that passes complex unit tests but utilizes minimal distinct constructs (scoring 0.6 + 0.3 + 0.0) yields a total reward of 0.9. Conversely, a program that is a complete hallucination, fails all tests, but possesses perfect syntax and massive AST density (scoring 0.6 + 0.0 + 0.1) yields a total reward of 0.7.

In a high-variance sampling environment at temperature 0.8, a margin of 0.2 between a perfect algorithmic solution and a highly-formatted hallucination is mathematically insufficient for the GRPO advantage estimator to decisively sever the adversarial behavior from the policy. The model will frequently update its weights in favor of the hallucination if the group mean happens to be slightly lower during that specific training step.31

### Recommendations from SOTA Code RL Literature

An analysis of leading code generation systems reveals sophisticated alternatives to static linear weights:

1. **DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-Coder-V2:** The DeepSeek architecture explicitly avoids arbitrary linear weighting of proxy metrics to prevent reward hacking. DeepSeek-R1 utilizes a strictly rule-based reward where accuracy and functional correctness act as a binary signal (1 or 0).47 It pairs this with a formatting reward strictly for the utilization of `<think>` reasoning tags, but the functional execution dictates the primary advantage.48 Furthermore, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-RL transitioned away from using raw 0/1 compiler feedback on partial test cases, opting instead to train a dedicated reward model on the compiler data. This trained reward model smooths the execution signal, rendering it more robust and capable of generalization than a raw, noisy syntax check.49

2. **AlphaCode 2:** Google DeepMind's AlphaCode 2 bypasses linear RL scalarization entirely during its post-training phase. It relies on the GOLD training objective for policy fine-tuning, coupled with massive randomized generation. It utilizes a completely separate, fine-tuned scoring model to estimate correctness probabilistically (between 0 and 1) based on execution and clustering algorithms, rather than relying on a hardcoded syntax-to-test ratio.50

3. **PPOCoder:** While the PPOCoder framework does incorporate syntactic (AST) and semantic matching (Data Flow Graphs) alongside compiler feedback, it does not rely on static 0.6 or 0.1 multipliers. Instead, it utilizes adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence coefficients and Value Function error coefficients to dynamically balance the reward components during the Proximal Policy Optimization training loop.5 This dynamic balancing ensures that structural matching guides the model initially but does not override functional correctness as the policy matures.

4. **CodeRL+:** Emphasizes *execution semantics alignment*. The research explicitly proves that over-optimizing for static syntax or token-level matching frequently leads to memorization and severely restricted performance when the model is faced with out-of-domain tasks or new datasets.5 CodeRL+ jointly trains execution semantic understanding with code generation, deriving its reward from variable-level execution trajectories rather than surface-level token patterns.53

*Evidence Quality Rating:* **Moderate to Strong**. While the exact scalar weights utilized by proprietary labs are occasionally obscured, open-source reproductions, technical reports (DeepSeek, OpenRLHF), and algorithmic analyses explicitly warn against heavily weighting low-barrier proxies like syntax over verifiable functional outcomes.
