# Rosetta Language Comparison: Pedagogy Research 2026

This document records the research findings that informed the redesign of the `expl-rosetta-inventory.md` explanation document. It compiles findings across four areas: cross-language documentation pedagogy, mechanism-level language details (C++, Python, Rust), durable execution models, and LLM static-typing synergies.

## 1. Cross-Language Tutorial Pedagogy

Web research indicates that traditional "straw-man" comparison pages alienate experienced developers. The most effective cross-language documentation follows specific principles:
- **Build mental-model bridges:** Use the reader's native vocabulary to describe new concepts.
- **Explain the mechanism, not just the symptom:** Asserting "this language has bug X" is weak; showing the language-internal mechanism that *produces* the bug builds trust.
- **Acknowledge the canonical fix:** Show what the source language actually recommends in practice, rather than acting like a naive mistake is structural.
- **Name the residual cost:** The true comparison is between the *fixed* source-language code and the target language's native model. 
- **No punchlines:** Engineering differences represent differing structural trade-offs, not mistakes in language design.

## 2. Language Mechanisms & Residual Costs

### C++: Iterator Invalidation UB
- **Mechanism:** In `std::vector`, calling `push_back()` when `size == capacity` triggers reallocation. A larger contiguous block is allocated, existing elements are copied/moved, and the old memory is freed. Any iterator, pointer, or reference pointing to the old block becomes dangling. Using it is Undefined Behavior (UB).
- **The Canonical Fix:** Capture an index instead of an iterator (`size_t idx = it - v.begin()`), then mutate, then use the index (`v[idx]`).
- **Residual Cost:** The fix resolves the UB, but the semantic trap remains. Iterators represent position, but position is tied to memory layout in a mutating container. Mismatches are caught at runtime via crashes or silent corruption, not by the type system.

### Rust: Concurrency Surface Area
- **Mechanism:** `Arc<Mutex<T>>`. `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counted) enables safe shared ownership across threads. `Mutex` enforces exclusive single-thread access to the inner value `T`.
- **The Protocol:** When mutable state is shared, Rust forces the caller to acknowledge and handle the locking sequence (acquire the lock, check for poison (panic during previous lock holder), and manage the RAII `MutexGuard` lifetime). `RwLock` is often preferred for read-heavy workloads.
- **Residual Cost:** The borrow checker successfully prevents data races. However, to achieve this safety, simple pure functions must have their API signatures expanded to include concurrency primitives, bleeding the infrastructure requirements out into the calling scope.

### Python: Mutable Default Arguments
- **Mechanism:** Python executes `def` statements once, at function definition time. Default argument values are evaluated at that moment and stored in the function object's `__defaults__` attribute. Thus, a mutable object (like `list` or `dict`) is instantiated once and shared by all calls that do not explicitly override that argument.
- **The Canonical Fix:** `def my_func(arg=None): if arg is None: arg = {}`.
- **Residual Cost:** While tools like `pylint` and `ruff` catch this instantly, the base language type system cannot enforce "unique instantiation per call," reducing architectural constraints to conventions.

## 3. Durable Execution (Temporal / Cloudflare Workers)

- **The Problem:** The "Double Charge" problem. In distributed systems, if a process crashes mid-workflow (e.g., after an external API call but before the database commits), restarting the function naively will re-execute the external effect. 
- **The Semantic Gap:** Standard `async/await` tracks state locally in memory.
- **The Solution:** Idempotency keys and event sourcing ("journaling"). Each workflow step result is appended to a durable log. On restart, the execution engine skips steps already in the journal, achieving "at-least-once" or "exactly-once" execution models. Hand-rolled implementations suffer from ad-hoc retry logic and missing coverage.

## 4. LLMs and Static Types

- **Finding:** Static type systems provide objective, rapid feedback loops for Code LLMs (like MENS/Qwen3). 
- **Mechanism:** If an LLM hallucinates an object field name in a dynamically typed language, the error surfaces only during runtime execution (or unit tests). In statically typed systems, the compiler catches the non-existent field instantly. This objective gradient improves the accuracy of agentic planning modes by fast-failing invalid code paths before execution.
