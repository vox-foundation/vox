# Memory Management & Per-Actor GC for LLM-Native Code Generation (Research 2026)

This document synthesizes our findings regarding memory management in Vox. Historically, Vox has lowered directly into Rust, adopting its value semantics natively. A core question in making Vox the premier LLM-first destination language is whether to retain Rust-like strict ownership/borrow-checking, or to adopt a traditional Garbage Collector (GC), all measured through the metric of **K-Complexity**.

K-Complexity is our holy grail: it measures the "simplicity" (Kolmogorov complexity) of the probability landscape an LLM must navigate to generate correct, idiomatic code.

## 1. The LLM Borrow-Checker Penalty

While Rust's borrow checker provides exceptional zero-cost abstractions for human engineers, it fundamentally frustrates LLMs (like the Qwen 3.5 class powering the MENS pipeline).

* **The Reasoning Gap:** Lifetimes create a deterministic and rigid probability landscape. When the context length expands, maintaining a consistent mental map of lifetimes across complex ASTs causes the LLM's probability generation to waver.
* **The "Path of Least Resistance":** Without an exhaustive semantic feedback loop, an LLM often resolves complex ownership problems by generating anti-patterns: excessive `.clone()` invocations or universally wrapping state in `Arc<Mutex<T>>`.
* **Impact on K-Complexity:** The necessity of reasoning about hardware constraints (lifetimes) while solving business domains drastically increases the K-Complexity of the required output tokens.

## 2. Global Garbage Collection vs. Technical Debt

If the borrow checker imposes high K-Complexity, the immediate alternative is a Global Tracing Garbage Collector (e.g., Java, C#, Go). 

* **Pros:** A GC abstracts memory completely. An LLM can emit procedural logic without tracking allocation boundaries. The K-Complexity of the business logic drops to near-zero.
* **Cons:** A global GC inevitably introduces Stop-The-World (STW) pauses. Furthermore, maintaining a sophisticated concurrent tracing root algorithm introduces unacceptable technical debt to the Vox runtime. We do not want to be in the business of writing multi-threaded garbage collectors.

## 3. The Resolution: Per-Actor Isolated GC (The Erlang Model)

In reviewing Vox's [Rosetta Inventory](../explanation/expl-rosetta-inventory.md), we observe a defining architectural invariant: **Vox outlaws shared mutable state, modeling concurrency strictly through Actors and mailboxes.**

This constraint reveals the ideal path forward: **Per-Actor Isolated Garbage Collection**.

Because actors communicate via copy-by-value message passing, state is never shared between actors. This allows Vox to implement small, localized garbage collectors *per actor*.

* **Performance Impact:** Micro-pauses occur per actor. There are no global STW pauses, ensuring system latency remains flat and predictable.
* **Technical Debt:** An isolated, single-threaded collector is drastically simpler to implement and maintain than global tracing algorithms.
* **K-Complexity Optimization:** LLMs can generate pure, garbage-collected logic inside the boundary of the actor, and the runtime will cleanly manage local allocations. Global consistency is naturally preserved through the actor messaging guarantees.

## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps

Moving forward, Vox will officially target a **Per-Actor GC** memory model. This aligns cleanly with our non-negotiable architectural invariant (the Actor model) while achieving our holy grail: minimizing K-Complexity to fully unlock LLM-native code generation.
