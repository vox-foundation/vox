# K-Complexity and Multi-File LLM Code Generation

The structural complexity of a codebase directly and measurably impacts the hallucination rate of code generation models. This relationship is formalized through the concept of Kolmogorov Complexity (K-complexity)—defined as the length of the shortest computer program that produces a given object or sequence as output.41

## The Multi-File Degradation Effect

While modern LLMs perform exceptionally well on isolated, single-file algorithmic challenges, their performance degrades precipitously in repository-level code generation scenarios spanning multiple files, modules, and interdependent architectures. The recently proposed MultiFileTest benchmark, which evaluates advanced models like Gemini-3.0-Pro on unit test generation across multi-file codebases, reveals that even frontier LLMs exhibit basic yet critical failures when context is split, specifically demonstrating high rates of "executability" and "cascade errors".43

When business logic is scattered across multiple files, the LLM must maintain a vast, coherent mental model of the system architecture within its limited context window. As the number of files, abstractions, and external dependencies increases, the K-complexity of the task rises exponentially. Studies monitoring the long-term use of LLMs in industrial codebases indicate that without automated guardrails tracking complexity hotspots and structural drift, LLM-assisted codebases rapidly degrade into unsustainable "tech debt," characterized by subtle naming drift, mismatched patterns, dependency creep, and fragmented logic.45

## K-Complexity Reduction as a Design Strategy

Evaluating code generation models via the KoLMogorov-Test (KT) demonstrates that models achieving higher compression rates (i.e., generating shorter, more succinct programs) exhibit substantially higher overall accuracy.46 Theoretical analyses of the Kolmogorov Structure Function suggest that LLM compression operates as a two-part coding process within the model's neural pathways; pervasive syntactic patterns are learned easily, while rare, highly specific knowledge elements are frequently lost or hallucinated.48

Therefore, reducing the K-complexity required to implement a feature directly improves LLM code quality. Languages that offer concise, highly expressive syntax without requiring excessive boilerplate for basic abstractions minimize the token length of the generated code. A smaller "code volume" reduces the overall surface area for latent bugs and keeps the entire context well within the LLM's optimal attention span.34

**Implication for Vox:** Every unnecessary boilerplate token in a required Vox program directly increases the K-complexity of the task and proportionally increases the hallucination risk. The language design must ruthlessly eliminate boilerplate while preserving semantic strictness.

## Confidence Assessment

There is **high confidence** that multi-file, multi-language codebase complexity severely degrades LLM code generation quality.43 Reducing the K-complexity of the target language is a critical requirement for maintaining performance at the repository level.
