# Multi-Agent Mesh Economics

## 1. Context
Analysis of the Tokenomics involved in orchestrating federated multi-agent networks (like Vox Populi) using heterogeneous routing between local hardware (RTX 4080) and cloud APIs.

## 2. Empirical Findings & Economic Realities

### The Communication Tax (The 15x Token Multiplier)
- To achieve parity with optimized single prompts, multi-agent systems use up to 15x the tokens due to context serialization.
- **Data Point:** ~60% of SW engineering agent tokens are completely burned in review/verification phases, with a pervasive 2:1 input-to-output token ratio.

### Asymptotic Analysis & Swarm Depth Scaling
- Evaluating agents using *Asymptotic Analysis of LLM Primitives (AALPs)* proves that fully meshed "debate" protocols scale at $O(N^2)$ complexity, leading to runaway costs.
- The mathematical optimal task decomposition depth is $N=9$ parallel sub-agents. Beyond this, orchestrator synthesis context explodes.

### The Cost Runaway Spiral
- Non-deterministic loop logic creates financial runaway (e.g., a documented $47,000 bill in 11 days from a standard LangChain retry loop failure). Rate limiting fails to protect budgets from sustained, normal-volume recursive loops.

## 3. Validated Architectural Adjustments

1. **Cascade Routing Matrix:** Route simple, high-volume filtering and context reduction to local nodes (Llama-3-8B). Escalate sequentially to Mid-Tier APIs (DeepSeek, Gemini Flash), reserving Frontier APIs (GPT-5.4, Opus) *strictly* for complex synthesis or deadlock recovery. Saves ~85% of total cost.
2. **5-Layer Cost Defense:** Implement programmatic circuit breakers:
   - Layer 1: Hard process-level Per-Cron timeouts.
   - Layer 2: Recovery Anti-Loops (max 3 re-attempts per task/day).
   - Layer 3: Centralized total cost-aggregate kill switch.
   - Layer 4: Strict Model Pinning to prevent fallback silent drifts into expensive Frontiers.
   - Layer 5: Long-term monthly pacing.
3. **Hardware Amortization:** Route operations requiring >9.1 million output tokens/day to internal RTX 4080 nodes to beat API TCO breakeven.
