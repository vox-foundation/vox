# CLI vs `compilerd` params

**Today:** [`crates/vox-cli/src/cli_args.rs`](../../../crates/vox-cli/src/cli_args.rs) (clap) and [`crates/vox-cli/src/compilerd.rs`](../../../crates/vox-cli/src/compilerd.rs) (`Deserialize` bodies) mirror overlapping flags/options.

**Target:** one contract-backed shape (or a single Rust struct carrying both `clap::Args` + serde) so CLI argv and daemon JSON cannot drift.

**Guardrails until merge:** `vox ci command-compliance` keeps registry / reachability / MCP wiring aligned; changing either surface requires updating both files deliberately.
