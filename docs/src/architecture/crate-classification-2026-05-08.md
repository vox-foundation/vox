# Crate Classification Audit (2026-05-08)

> **Snapshot note:** This is a point-in-time audit snapshot from 2026-05-08, used to inform the workspace reorg + crate-org-followup work. Crate classifications below reflect the *pre-fix* state — see `2026-05-08-workspace-reorg-outcome.md` and `2026-05-08-crate-org-followup-design.md` for what actually shipped.

This audit classifies every crate in `crates/` against five labels:

- **CORE** — compiled into the default `vox-cli` binary (no feature flags required)
- **PLUGIN** — heavy deps or hardware-specific; ships as a dylib plugin
- **SHARED** — used by both CORE crates and PLUGIN crates; must remain in the workspace
- **DEAD** — zero consumers in `Cargo.toml`; candidate for deletion after verification
- **MISPLACED** — compiled as CORE today but should be extracted to a plugin

> Methodology: `grep -r "<crate>" crates/ --include="Cargo.toml"` to count consumers, combined with review of `vox-cli/Cargo.toml` direct/transitive deps. Feature-gated-only deps (optional = true) are noted.

## DEAD crates — Deletion Candidates

The following crates have zero consumers in `Cargo.toml` files across the workspace. They are safe to remove after verifying they have no external users or build-script roles:

| Crate | Reason |
|---|---|
| `vox-exec-grammar` | No Cargo.toml consumer found |
| `vox-grammar-export` | No Cargo.toml consumer found |
| `vox-schola` | Inline serde types in `vox-ml-cli/merge_qlora.rs` replaced it; plugin owns merge |
| `vox-scientia-core` | No consumers; social/ingestion pipeline not wired |
| `vox-scientia-social` | No consumers |
| `vox-scientia-ingest` | No consumers |
| `vox-socrates-policy` | No consumers |
| `vox-spool` | No consumers |
| `vox-webhook` | No consumers |
| `vox-tools` | Orphaned; `vox-oratio` was extracted to a plugin |
| `vox-mcp-meta` | MCP meta stub; no consumers |
| `vox-mcp-registry` | Orphaned MCP registry |
| `vox-doc-inventory` | No consumers |
| `vox-integration-tests` | Self-contained test binary but no CI wiring found |
| `vox-test-harness` | No consumers |
| `vox-browser` | BrowserAutomation extracted to `vox-plugin-browser`; this crate is the old host-side abstraction with zero consumers left |

> **Action**: Before deleting each, verify `cargo check --workspace` still compiles. Run `cargo tree -p vox-cli | grep <crate>` for each — if empty, proceed to delete.

---

## MISPLACED crates — Extraction Candidates

| Crate | Current State | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vox-oratio` | Used optionally in vox-ml-cli and vox-orchestrator; pulls in heavy Candle deps | Finish extraction to `vox-plugin-oratio`; all remaining uses should go through the plugin dispatch boundary |
| `vox-audio-ingress` | Only consumer is itself (via `vox-oratio` dep); orphaned | Delete or fold into vox-plugin-oratio-mic |
| `vox-ssg` | In vox-cli directly; SSG is a publishing concern, not core CLI | Consider extracting SSG commands to a skill plugin; low urgency |

---

## SHARED crates — Must Remain

These are used by both CORE and PLUGIN code paths and cannot be safely moved:

| Crate | Reason |
|---|---|
| `vox-plugin-api` | The stable ABI surface itself |
| `vox-plugin-host` | Host-side discovery + loader; called from vox-cli |
| `vox-plugin-catalog` | SSOT used by vox-cli CI gates |
| `vox-mesh-types` | Mesh types shared across core and populi-mesh plugin |
| `vox-orchestrator-types` | Task/budget types shared across orchestrator and plugin dispatch |
| `vox-tensor` | `data`, `grpo`, `replay`, `lora_config` modules used by both plugins and core; GPU-gated modules only used in plugins |

---

## `vox-tensor` — Deduplication Note

`vox-tensor` currently duplicates several types that also exist in `vox-populi/src/mens/tensor/`:

- `LoraConfig` / `lora_memory_estimate` — both `vox-tensor/src/lora_config.rs` and `vox-populi/src/mens/tensor/lora/` define them
- GPU-gated modules (`lora`, `optim`, `tensor`, `train`, `vox_nn`) — these should move to `vox-plugin-tensor-burn-wgpu`; the remaining always-compiled modules (`data`, `grpo`, `replay`, `lora_config`) are the actual shared surface

**Recommended**: Keep `vox-tensor` as a SHARED crate but shrink its scope to only the non-GPU modules (`data`, `grpo`, `replay`, `lora_config`). The GPU modules belong in `vox-plugin-tensor-burn-wgpu/src/`.

---

## Catalog Dead Entries

Two plugin IDs appear in `catalog.toml` but have no corresponding crate in `crates/`:

| Catalog ID | Status |
|---|---|
| `execution-api` | No `vox-plugin-execution-api` crate; referenced only in catalog with `bundled-in = []` |
| `stub-check` | No `vox-plugin-stub-check` crate; referenced only in catalog with `bundled-in = []` |

These are pre-declared future plugins. They are harmless (not in any bundle), but their `default-source` points to non-existent GitHub repos. They should either be removed from the catalog or have placeholder crates created.

---

## Recommendations (Priority Order)

1. **Delete DEAD crates** (P1, low risk): Start with `vox-exec-grammar`, `vox-grammar-export`, `vox-schola`. Run `cargo check` after each batch.
2. **Remove catalog ghost entries** (P2, trivial): Delete `execution-api` and `stub-check` entries from `catalog.toml` or add placeholder crates.
3. **Finish oratio extraction** (P2): Move remaining `vox-oratio` uses to `vox-plugin-oratio` dispatch.
4. **Shrink vox-tensor GPU surface** (P3): Move `lora`, `optim`, `tensor`, `train`, `vox_nn` into `vox-plugin-tensor-burn-wgpu`. Keep non-GPU modules.
5. **Delete `vox-browser`** (P3): Zero consumers; `vox-plugin-browser` is the canonical implementation.
