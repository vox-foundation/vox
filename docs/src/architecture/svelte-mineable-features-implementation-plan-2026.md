# Svelte-Mineable Features Implementation Plan (2026)

Companion to [Svelte 5/6 vs React Meta-Frameworks Research (2026)](svelte-vs-react-frameworks-research-2026.md). The research identifies seven items (M1–M7) worth porting from Svelte. This document is the concrete plan to land them.

## Critical alignment note (added 2026-05-02 after verification round 2)

**Angle-bracket JSX source is retired in favor of view-call syntax and typed semantic primitives.** Parser entry now lowers `Tag(named=props) { ... }` / `Tag(named=props)` via [pratt_match.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/expr/pratt_match.rs), while angle-bracket forms are no longer a parser entry. The replacement direction is still **TASK-6.1 — Vox GUI semantic primitive set** in the [GUI-native roadmap](vox-gui-native-roadmap-2026.md): typed primitives (`stack`, `row`, `column`, `text`, `button`, `field`, `panel`, `card`, `list`, `route_outlet`, …) with **fixed prop signatures** that emit canonical HTML + Tailwind. The Web IR primitives module is scaffolded ([web_ir/primitives/mod.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/web_ir/primitives/mod.rs)) but per-primitive files have not yet been created. Per the doc: "Each primitive has a fixed prop signature (no prop extension, period). Declares which HTML tag it emits. Declares its accessibility affordances. Accepts typed token refs for visual properties."

**Implications for the phases below:**

- **Phase B (`bind:` / `class:` / `style:` directive families) is partially obsoleted.** `bind:value` should be a prop convention on the `field` primitive (typed against the field's value type), not a JSX directive. `class:NAME` is not coherent against fixed-prop-signature primitives — replace with `surface={cond ? "primary" : "default"}` on the primitive. `style:--TOKEN` is already covered by the primitives' typed token-ref props (`gap`, `size`, `weight`, `surface`). **Recommendation: rescope Phase B as "binding/state-flow conventions on the Phase-6 primitives" and execute it as part of Phase 6, not as standalone JSX work.**
- **Phase F (typed fragments) should wait for Phase 6 primitives to stabilize.** Designing fragment composition against the deprecated JSX authoring surface would create a second migration. Defer until the 10 highest-usage primitives ship.
- **Phases A, C, D, E, G are unaffected** — none touches the JSX-vs-primitives surface.

This note supersedes the earlier "Phase B is small" framing.

## Premise

Vox already ships more of the Svelte-style surface than the original research draft credited:

- `state` / `derived` / `effect` / `on mount` / `on cleanup` / `view:` are working reactive primitives **inside `component { }` blocks** ([reactive_counter.vox](../../../examples/golden/reactive_counter.vox), [codegen_ts/reactive.rs:740–815](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/reactive.rs)).
- Auto-dep inference for `derived`/`effect` already runs ([hir_emit/state_deps.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/state_deps.rs)) — emits the React deps array automatically. It descends into lambdas; it does not cross function-decl boundaries.
- `on:click`, `on:change`, `on:input`, `on:submit`, `on:keydown` directive-style attributes ship today ([compat.rs:27–42](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/compat.rs)). The parser path that lowers view-calls already accepts arbitrary `name:suffix` and `name-suffix` attribute names ([pratt_match.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/expr/pratt_match.rs)).
- A `vox_validate_file` MCP tool that runs the full compiler pipeline is registered ([tool-registry.canonical.yaml:1211](../../../contracts/mcp/tool-registry.canonical.yaml)) and dispatched ([mcp_tools/dispatch.rs:237](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/dispatch.rs)).
- A `state_machine` keyword emits typed states + events + a reducer function stub ([state_machine_emit.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/state_machine_emit.rs)).
- Web IR validates literal `href`/`to` attributes against declared route patterns ([web_ir/validate.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/web_ir/validate.rs)).

Each phase below is sized against this real baseline, not a clean slate. Phase work should land via the same TDD/review discipline used for the GUI roadmap ([gui-native-roadmap-status-2026.md](gui-native-roadmap-status-2026.md)).

```

| Phase | Item | Est. scope | Depends on | Needs ADR? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | M5 — `vox_validate_source` + autofix surfacing | **✅ Code + docs complete** ([8ae08edab](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)). `DiagnosticInfo.{code,fixes}` plumbed end-to-end; new `vox_validate_source` tool in registry/dispatch/http_gateway. User-facing how-to at [how-to-mcp-vox-validate.md](../how-to/how-to-mcp-vox-validate.md) ([423a44e7e](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)) covers Claude Desktop / Cursor wiring, diagnostic shape, the iterate-against-the-compiler loop, and the diagnostic-code namespaces. | — | No |
| B | M3 — Binding/state-flow conventions on **Phase-6 primitives** (rescoped) | Folds into Phase 6 (`stack`, `field`, `button`, …). Do not pursue as standalone JSX directive work | TASK-6.1 | Coordinated with Phase-6 ADR |
| C | M6 — Route segment-aware overlap + typed `href` | **✅ Foundation + integration shipped** ([e0dd30fb0](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [5be659ed1](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)). `RoutePattern::parse` + `Overlap::{None,Shadowed,Ambiguous}` + `validate_express_route_emit_input` upgraded to segment-aware. **✅ Typed `routePath` builder shipped** ([latest](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)). `KnownRoute` union + `routePath["/users/:id"](id)` builder map in `routes.manifest.ts`. **`url`-decl ↔ routes cross-validation deferred** — slice A bypassed the need by generating builders directly from route patterns; explicit `url` decls remain a general-purpose typed-URL construct independent of `routes { }`. | — | No |
| D | M1+M4 — `.vox.ui` modules (reactive members at module scope) | **✅ Shipped end-to-end.** FileKind helper + `parse_with_kind` ([954ad8775](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)); `Decl::ReactiveModule` AST + parser ([26c90f9be](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)); `HirReactiveModule` + lowering + `reactive_module_emit.rs` codegen emits `<Name>Provider.tsx` (typed `Value` interface + Context + Provider component + `use<Name>()` hook). Module name PascalCases from snake/kebab; falls back to `ReactiveModule<index>` when parser leaves it empty. CLI wire-up to pass file basename through is the remaining sub-slice. | — | **✅ ADR-032 accepted** |
| E | M1 — Cross-call auto-dep inference + `@reactive` decorator | **✅ Shipped end-to-end** ([5db51fc0a](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [a1c6f46ec](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [6691bf831](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)). `@reactive` decorator parses + lowers; analyzer recurses one level into `@reactive` callees with a self-reference guard; reactive emit uses the analyzer; tier-2 `dep_inference.over_track` hint surface emits a `// dep_inference.over_track` comment in TSX naming unannotated callees. | — | No |
| F | M2 — Typed parametric fragment primitive | **✅ Shipped end-to-end.** Lexer `Token::Fragment` + AST + parser dispatch ([6f01b8ae1](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)); HIR `HirFragmentDecl` + lowering + `fragment_emit.rs` codegen ships `fragments.tsx` with typed React function components and `Args` prop interfaces. Phase 6 primitive surface unblocked the codegen mid-cycle. | TASK-6.1 + ADR-033 | **✅ ADR-033 accepted** |
| G | M7 — Reactive-class state-machine instances | **✅ Shipped end-to-end.** Runtime `ReactiveStateMachine<S, E>` helper in `vox-runtime/src/state_machine.rs` (Rust-side instance; 5 unit tests). Codegen `state_machine_emit.rs` now emits a `use<Name>StateMachine(initial)` React hook alongside the reducer, returning `{ state, send }`. The hook owns `useState` of the current state and a memoized `send(event)` running the reducer. | D | No |

**Shipped this session (2026-05-02 → 2026-05-03):** Phases A, C foundation + integration + typed-builder, E foundation + wiring + tier-2. Plus housekeeping: ADR-032 drafted ([0fcb7340d](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [4df880e7c](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [e45629d8f](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [277942a63](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox), [f0a3d1b75](https://github.com/vox-foundation/vox)) — orphan-snapshot cleanup, two stale-test fixes (ADR-028 / TASK-2.6 alignment), inbound-link goldens fix, `view_roots`-setup gap fix, contributor doc note on snapshot-baseline workflow. Full vox-compiler test suite went from 7 known failures → 0.

Phases A, B, C, D, E, F are independent and can land in parallel by separate sessions. G depends on D.

---

## Phase A — `vox_validate_source` MCP tool + autofix surfacing (M5)

**Why first:** the capability is shipped; the AI-usable contract is not. Three days of work on the response shape and one new sibling tool unlock every other phase's testability via "ask the AI to write Vox; let the AI iterate against the compiler."

**Goal.** Make the compile-and-validate loop usable from any MCP-aware coding agent without the agent first writing files to disk.

### Concrete changes

1. **New tool `vox_validate_source`** that takes `{ source: string, virtual_path?: string }` and returns the same diagnostic shape as `vox_validate_file` without touching the filesystem.
   - Add registry entry: `contracts/mcp/tool-registry.canonical.yaml` (alongside `vox_validate_file` at line 1211).
   - Add dispatch arm: [crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/dispatch.rs:237](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/dispatch.rs) (sibling to `vox_validate_file`).
   - Add input schema: [crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/input_schemas.rs:160](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/input_schemas.rs) (alongside the existing `vox_validate_file` schema).
   - Wire through `http_gateway`: [crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/http_gateway/mod.rs:57](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/http_gateway/mod.rs).
   - Implementation: invoke the same observer path used by `vox_validate_file`, but feed it source bytes via a temp `Cursor` or in-memory virtual filesystem rather than `resolve_existing_path_in_repository`.

2. **Structured autofix in the diagnostic response.** Today, `validate_file` ([code_validator.rs:63–88](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/code_validator.rs)) returns full LSP-style `DiagnosticInfo { severity, message, source, start_line, start_col, end_line, end_col }` from `vox_lsp::validate_document_with_hir`. The struct has **no `fix` field** — the existing autofix `FixSuggestion`s ([typeck/autofix.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/typeck/autofix.rs)) never reach the MCP boundary. Add a `fixes: Vec<FixInfo>` field to `DiagnosticInfo` (in [params.rs](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/params.rs)) and thread the autofix list from `vox_lsp` through the conversion. Each `FixInfo` carries `{ message, range: { start, end }, replacement_text, explanation }`. Note: also check `vox_check` ([code_validator.rs:92](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/code_validator.rs:92)) — it's the second validation entry point and needs the same field added for consistency.

3. **Documentation.** New how-to at `docs/src/how-to/how-to-mcp-vox-validate.md`:
   - "Point your coding agent at the Vox MCP server."
   - Concrete `claude_desktop_config.json` and Cursor MCP config snippets that wire `vox` → stdio MCP server → `vox_validate_source` / `vox_validate_file` / `vox_compiler::ast_inspect`.
   - Worked example: agent writes a buggy Vox component, calls `vox_validate_source`, receives a diagnostic with autofix, applies it, re-validates.

4. **Update `llms.txt`.** Add a section in [docs/src/.well-known/llms.txt](.well-known/llms.txt) pointing AI clients at the MCP-server how-to.

### Verification

- New unit test in [mcp_tools/dispatch.rs](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/dispatch.rs) tests for `vox_validate_source`: pass a source string with a known-error idiom (e.g., `<img>` without `alt`), assert the response includes the `web_ir_validate.a11y.img.missing_alt` diagnostic and at least one autofix suggestion.
- Integration test mirrors a real MCP client roundtrip via the stdio server.
- Add to [http_gateway_tests.rs](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/mcp_tools/http_gateway_tests.rs).

### Out of scope for this phase

- vox-bench corpus / scoring harness. Deferred per research §M5.
- Web UI for inspecting diagnostics. Use the existing dashboard if needed.

---

## Phase B — `bind:`, `class:`, `style:` directive families (M3)

**Why second:** the syntactic infrastructure is in place. The parser already accepts `name:suffix` attribute names. The mapping table and lowering logic at [compat.rs:27–42](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/compat.rs) is the only place new families need to be wired. No grammar change.

**Decision recorded:** **separator is colon `:`**, identical to the established `on:*` family. Consistent, parser-free, no syntactic carve-out needed.

### Concrete changes

1. **Extend [`hir_emit/compat.rs`](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/compat.rs) `map_jsx_attr_name`** with new directive families:
   - `bind:value` — lowers to `value={x}` + auto-emitted `onChange={e => set_x(e.target.value)}` when `x` is a reactive `state` binding. The setter name `set_x` is already the convention emitted by [reactive.rs:761](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/reactive.rs:761) (`const [{}, set_{}] = useState({});`).
   - `bind:checked` — same pattern with `e.target.checked`.
   - `bind:group` — emits a coordinated set of controlled inputs (radio group). Lower priority; gate behind a feature flag if it adds scope.
   - `class:NAME` — the directive after the colon is the class name; lowers to `className={clsx(existing, { NAME: value })}` (or simpler ternary if no other `className`). Requires a small clsx-style runtime helper or inline ternary composition.
   - `style:--TOKEN` and `style:PROP` — lowers to `style={{ '--TOKEN': value }}` / `style={{ propCamelCase: value }}` merged with any existing `style` attribute.

2. **New diagnostic codes** for misuse:
   - `directive.bind.target_not_state` — `bind:value={x}` where `x` is not a reactive `state` binding. Autofix: suggest converting to a one-way `value={x}` with separate handler, or wrapping `x` as state.
   - `directive.bind.type_mismatch` — `bind:value` on `<input type="number">` requires a numeric `state`. Reuse the existing typeck infrastructure.
   - `directive.class.empty_name` — `class:={…}` (missing class name).
   - `directive.style.unknown_property` — `style:bogus={…}` not a known CSS property and not a CSS custom property.

3. **HIR pass.** When the JSX attribute name has a recognized directive prefix, lower it to a structured `HirDirective { family, name, value }` rather than passing the raw string through. This unblocks the typeck checks above.

4. **Web IR alignment.** [web_ir/lower.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/web_ir/) maps attributes to behavior nodes; ensure directive-attributed elements land in the right behavior bucket.

5. **Update [examples/golden/reactive_counter.vox](../../../examples/golden/reactive_counter.vox)** to demonstrate `bind:value` for a controlled input alongside the existing `on:click` use, and add a new golden `examples/golden/form_directives.vox` covering all five families.

6. **Doctest fences** in `docs/src/tutorials/` covering each directive (auto-validated by the doc pipeline; no `// vox:skip`).

### Verification

- Compiler unit tests in `crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/compat.rs#tests` for each new directive's TSX output (snapshot tests).
- Web IR validation tests for the new diagnostic codes.
- Reactive smoke test ([crates/vox-compiler/tests/reactive_smoke.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/tests/reactive_smoke.rs)) extended to cover `bind:value` round-trip.
- New golden file passes `vox check` and produces stable TSX.

### Out of scope

- A `use:action` directive (Svelte's "actions"). Park; no clear use case yet.
- Two-way binding for component-prop pass-through (`bind:prop` on a component). Decide separately when needed.

---

## Phase C — Route segment-aware overlap detection + typed `href` helper (M6)

**Why parallel-able:** independent of the reactive surface. Touches only `routes`-related code paths.

### Concrete changes

1. **Replace exact-string-match conflict detection** at [codegen_ts/routes.rs:87](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/routes.rs):
   - Introduce a `RoutePattern` type that parses `/users/:id` into segment kinds (`Literal("users")`, `Param("id")`, `Wildcard`).
   - Conflict rule: two routes of the same method conflict if their segment lists unify under any concrete substitution (literal-vs-literal must match; literal-vs-param wins specificity to literal; param-vs-param ambiguous → conflict diagnostic with documented precedence rule).
   - Emit diagnostic code `routes.overlap.unresolvable_precedence` for ambiguous overlap (e.g., two `/:a/:b` routes); allow `routes.overlap.shadowed` (info-level) when one literal route shadows a param route.

2. **Typed `href` helper.** Generate a `routes` module in TSX emit that exports a typed builder:
   ```text
   // emitted TSX (illustrative)
   export const routes = {
     users: { show: (id: string) => `/users/${id}` },
     // …
   } as const;
   ```
   Authors can then write `<a href={routes.users.show(userId)}>` and get full type-flow. Requires extending [route_manifest.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/route_manifest.rs) emit.

3. **Loosen the broken-link validator** at [web_ir/validate.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/web_ir/validate.rs) to accept dynamic expressions whose static type resolves to a known route-builder return value. Hand-written literal `href="/whatever"` continues to be checked exactly.

4. **Reuse the route-pattern parser** for the path-param decorators in [phase3-http-ergonomics-spec-2026.md](phase3-http-ergonomics-spec-2026.md) — there is shared scaffolding to extract here.

### Verification

- Unit tests for `RoutePattern::parse`, `RoutePattern::overlaps_with`.
- Goldens covering the three overlap cases (no overlap, shadowed, ambiguous).
- TSX emit snapshot for the generated `routes` builder.

### Out of scope

- Search-param typing (TanStack Router's `validateSearch`). Decide separately.
- Loader-result type-flow into component props (Phase 4 tail).

---

## Phase D — `.vox.ui` reactive modules (M1 module-scope half + M4)

**Why this needs an ADR.** A new file-suffix convention is grammar-adjacent policy. Decide once, document the SSOT, and don't churn it. ADR scope: the `.vox.ui` suffix, what's allowed at module scope, how cross-module reactive imports lower in TSX emit.

### Concrete changes

1. **ADR draft** at `docs/src/adr/032-vox-ui-reactive-modules.md`:
   - Suffix: `.vox.ui` (matches the precedent of suffixed file conventions established by `.generated.md` and `.voxignore`-derived files in [AGENTS.md §Auto-generated docs](../../../AGENTS.md)).
   - Allowed top-level decls in a `.vox.ui` file: regular Vox decls (`type`, `fn`, `component`) **plus** module-scope `state` / `derived` / `effect` / `on mount` / `on cleanup`.
   - Disallowed in a regular `.vox` file: module-scope reactive members (existing behavior, made explicit).
   - Lowering: each `.vox.ui` file emits a TSX module exporting a React context + provider + `use<Name>()` hook.

2. **Parser change** at [parser/descent/mod.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/mod.rs): when the input file's path ends in `.vox.ui`, allow the existing `Token::State`/`Token::Derived`/`Token::Effect`/`Token::On + Mount/Cleanup` branches at the top-level decl matcher (currently only legal inside `finish_reactive_component_after_name`).

3. **New AST/HIR node `ReactiveModule`** at [ast/decl/ui.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/ast/decl/ui.rs) — wraps the same `Vec<ReactiveMemberDecl>` already used by `ReactiveComponentDecl`.

4. **Codegen** at [codegen_ts/reactive.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/reactive.rs): mirror the `ReactiveComponentDecl` lowering but emit a context+provider+hook scaffold instead of a function component.

5. **Cross-module reactive imports.** A regular `.vox` `component { }` that imports `count` from `./counter.vox.ui` should have the import auto-rewritten in TSX emit to a `useCounterStore()` call. Read-tracking analysis (Phase E below) needs to know that the imported binding is reactive.

6. **Two new goldens:** `examples/golden/counter.vox.ui` (the store) and `examples/golden/counter_consumer.vox` (the component). Add to the doc-pipeline doctest suite.

### Verification

- Parser tests for both legal (in `.vox.ui`) and illegal (in `.vox`) module-scope reactive members.
- Codegen snapshot tests for the emitted provider/hook shape.
- End-to-end golden round-trip.

### Out of scope

- Persistence / hydration (don't smuggle in a state-management library). Pure in-memory reactive store only.
- Server-side rendering coordination across multiple `.vox.ui` modules. Decide separately if/when SSR comes up for the reactive surface.

---

## Phase E — Cross-call auto-dep inference (M1 closure-tracking half)

**User direction:** track reads through closures, but cost-bound the analysis (no whole-program escape analysis). Conservative over-tracking is acceptable when proving reachability is expensive.

### Cost model

Three tiers, each with a bounded analysis budget:

| Tier | Tracks | Analysis cost | Action when over budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Direct identifier reads in the same expression tree | O(nodes) | (always run) |
| 2 | Reads inside `HirExpr::Lambda` bodies whose closure escapes to an effect/derived | O(nodes × lambda depth) | already implemented at [state_deps.rs:95](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/state_deps.rs:95); extend to track closure-captured reactive bindings |
| 3 | Reads through `HirExpr::Call` to a free function declared in the same module | O(callees × analysis budget) | gate on `@reactive`-annotated callees only; otherwise emit `dep_inference.over_track` info diagnostic and add the conservative "everything in scope" dep set |

Whole-program / cross-crate / dynamic-dispatch analysis: explicitly **not** implemented. Authors get a clean opt-in (`@reactive fn compute(x: int) -> int { … }`) for free functions that should participate in dep tracking; without the annotation, the call site over-tracks (correct but pessimistic).

### Concrete changes

1. **Extend [`hir_emit/state_deps.rs`](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/hir_emit/state_deps.rs)** with a `ReadAnalyzer` struct that:
   - Carries a budget (default 100 expression nodes per analysis call; configurable via env or `Vox.toml`).
   - Tracks visited callees in a `HashSet<DeclId>` to bound recursion.
   - When budget is exhausted, returns a `DepSet::Conservative` variant that emits the "over-tracked" diagnostic and falls back to "every reactive binding in scope."

2. **`@reactive` decorator on free `fn` declarations.** Per [AGENTS.md §Grammar Unification](../../../AGENTS.md), this is a decorator on `fn` — fits the existing decorator pattern, no new bare keyword. Marks the function body as eligible for cross-call dep inference; the analyzer descends into the function's HIR body.

3. **Lowering preserved.** The emitted React `useMemo([…])` / `useEffect([…])` deps array remains the existing one when analysis succeeds. When `DepSet::Conservative` triggers, emit a comment in the TSX explaining the over-track (helps debuggers understand why the dep array is large).

4. **Diagnostic codes:**
   - `dep_inference.over_track` (info) — analysis exhausted budget; conservative dep set used.
   - `dep_inference.unannotated_call` (info, opt-in via lint level) — `derived`/`effect` calls a non-`@reactive` free function; the read may be missed. Suggest annotating the callee.

### Verification

- Unit tests for each tier in `state_deps.rs#tests`.
- Snapshot test: a `derived label = format(count)` where `format` is `@reactive fn format(c: int) -> str { "v=" + str(c) }` produces deps `[count]`.
- Snapshot test: same code with no `@reactive` annotation produces `DepSet::Conservative` and the info diagnostic.

### Out of scope (the "may-being" the user asked us to be conservative on)

- **Speculative escape analysis** (proving a closure does or does not escape). Don't.
- **Effect-typed analysis** (Koka/Eff-style row-polymorphic effect tracking). Don't.
- **Cross-crate tracking.** Don't.
- **Dynamic-dispatch resolution.** Don't.

If a future need surfaces (e.g., MENS-spoke wants per-call effect inference for a specific reason), revisit then with a concrete consumer.

---

## Phase F — Typed parametric fragment primitive (M2)

**Largest scope.** New bare-keyword scope per the grammar policy → new lexer token, new parser production, new AST/HIR node, new codegen, new validation. Needs an ADR.

### ADR scope

`docs/src/adr/033-typed-fragment-primitive.md`:
- Keyword choice (recommend `fragment`, alternatives `block` / `slot` / `template` discussed and rejected with rationale).
- Type system: `Fragment[(T1, T2, …)]` as the type of a parametric fragment. Empty arg list valid.
- Render syntax: decide between `<RenderFragment of={Row} args={[item]} />` (JSX-shaped) or `@render Row(item)` (decorator-shaped). Recommend the former for consistency with existing JSX, but note both have proponents.
- Lowering policy: emit fragments as typed React function components with a `Fragment.children` prop convention.

### Concrete changes (post-ADR)

1. New lexer token `Token::Fragment` at [lexer/token.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/lexer/token.rs).
2. New AST node `FragmentDecl` at [ast/decl/](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/ast/decl/).
3. New parser production at [parser/descent/decl/](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/decl/).
4. New HIR node `HirFragmentDecl`.
5. New codegen at `crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/fragment_emit.rs`.
6. Web IR validation: ensure fragments referenced in JSX exist; ensure the right number/types of args are passed.
7. Goldens: at minimum `examples/golden/fragment_table_row.vox` (a `<Table>` parameterized by a row fragment).

### Verification

- ADR review and merge first.
- Each lexer/parser/AST/HIR/codegen layer gets unit tests.
- End-to-end golden round-trip with TSX snapshot.

### Out of scope

- Recursive fragments calling themselves (the Svelte case). Decide separately.
- Fragments exported from `.vox.ui` modules — Phase F lands fragments at module/component scope of regular `.vox` files; cross-module fragment export is a follow-up.

---

## Phase G — Reactive-class state-machine instances (M7)

**Depends on Phase D** if instances should be usable from `.vox.ui` modules without a component wrapper.

### Concrete changes

1. **Extend [state_machine_emit.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/state_machine_emit.rs)** to additionally emit:
   - A `useFooStateMachine(initial: FooState): { state: FooState, send: (e: FooEvent) => void }` hook for in-component use — internally a `useState` + the existing reducer.
   - An exported reactive class `class Foo { state = $state(initial); send(e: FooEvent) { this.state = fooReducer(this.state, e); } }` for `.vox.ui`-module use (depends on Phase D).
2. **Stdlib helper** in `vox-stdlib` (or `vox-runtime` if stdlib doesn't exist yet — verify against repo state at implementation time): a generic `<S, E>` reactive-state-machine wrapper that the codegen-emitted class extends. Avoids per-state-machine boilerplate.
3. **Update existing state-machine goldens** to use the new instance API. Keep the discriminated-union types and pure reducer function as the testable primitives.

### Verification

- Unit tests for the emitted hook (renders, dispatches an event, observes state change).
- Reactive-class goldens validated by the doc pipeline.

---

## Cross-cutting concerns

- **Doc-pipeline doctests.** All `.vox` snippets in this plan's downstream docs must compile cleanly per [AGENTS.md §Markdown Hygiene](../../../AGENTS.md). Use `// vox:skip` only when illustrating a deliberate error.
- **Goldens.** Each phase adds its own golden(s) under `examples/golden/`. Update the existing parity tests (Web IR vs legacy emit, G4) to cover the new emission paths.
- **Telemetry.** Emit `vox.compiler.directive.*`, `vox.compiler.dep_inference.*`, `vox.mcp.validate_source.*` events for observability of how the new surfaces are being used.
- **No new bare keywords without an ADR.** Phases D and F trigger ADRs (file-suffix convention; new bare-keyword scope). Phases A/B/C/E/G do not need ADRs because they extend existing surfaces.
- **Backward compatibility.** Every phase preserves the existing reactive-component, JSX-attribute, route-block, and state-machine surfaces unchanged. Only additive changes to the lowering layer.
- **Migration.** No migration commands needed — none of these are removals. The existing React-hook bridge ([react_bridge.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/react_bridge.rs)) stays as the escape hatch.

## Explicitly deferred

- **vox-bench / SvelteBench analog.** No defined consumer for the metric. Revisit when a specific gating decision (e.g., "should we upgrade the MENS spoke to model X") would be informed by the score.
- **`use:action` directive.** No clear use case. Revisit if a third-party Vox component library asks for it.
- **Two-way `bind:` on component props** (cross-component data flow). Out of Phase B; decide when a real consumer surfaces.
- **Whole-program / cross-crate dep inference.** Cost is not justified by current evidence.
- **Search-param typing in routes.** Out of Phase C; decide separately.
- **A first-party `import svelte …` form.** Per the [research doc §Interop position](svelte-vs-react-frameworks-research-2026.md), no.
