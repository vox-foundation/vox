# Toolchain Reality and Omnibus Installer Findings

*May 2026*

## Context

The Vox project advertises a single-command installation experience (`brew install`, `dpkg -i`, `.msi`). However, while this successfully distributes the `vox-cli` binary, it masks a significant level of underlying toolchain complexity required to actually compile and execute full-stack Vox applications.

This document details the reality of the hidden dependencies, the user friction they create, and the high-value architectural initiatives required to make the "single-command install" claim functionally true.

## The Reality Behind the Scenes

An audit of the `vox doctor` source code (`crates/vox-cli/src/commands/diagnostics/doctor/checks_standard/toolchain.rs`) reveals that the CLI acts primarily as an orchestrator, delegating heavily to external system toolchains:

1. **Frontend Bundling (The Node Ecosystem):** `vox build` and `vox deploy` silently invoke the local Node.js runtime and `pnpm` to transpile and bundle React/TSX artifacts.
2. **Backend & WASM Execution (The Rust Ecosystem):** The `vox run --isolation wasm` sandbox expects the user to have `rustup` installed along with the `wasm32-wasip1` target. Native ML inference (`vox populi` via Burn/Candle) similarly relies on the local Cargo toolchain.
3. **OS & Networking:** Distributed mesh workflows require external VPNs (Tailscale/WireGuard), and package fetching relies on `git`. Linux compilations strongly prefer `mold` and `Cranelift`.

**The Gap:** A user on a fresh machine who installs Vox via `.msi` and runs `vox init my-app && vox run src/main.vox` will experience a confusing cascade of failures as the CLI tries to shell out to missing `pnpm` or `rustup` binaries. `vox doctor --auto-heal` attempts to mitigate this by installing `pnpm` via `npm`, but this requires `npm` to exist in the first place.

## High-Value Initiatives (Path to Independence)

To align runtime reality with the installation claims and eliminate "K-complexity" for the end-user, we propose the following independent initiatives:

### 1. The Native Bundler Swap (Eliminate Node.js)
As specified in Phase 9 of the GUI-native roadmap (TASK-7.3), Vox must replace the Node.js/pnpm dependency for frontend builds with a native Rust-based bundler integrated directly into the `vox` binary (e.g., `Rolldown` or `Oxc`).
- **Impact:** Severs reliance on the JavaScript ecosystem for compilation. Users no longer need Node.js or `node_modules` locally to compile their web applications.

### 2. Embedded WASM Toolchain (Eliminate Cargo for Sandboxing)
Instead of invoking the host's `cargo` and requiring `wasm32-wasip1`, Vox should ship with pre-compiled standard library WASM blobs or bundle a lightweight WASM compiler backend (like Cranelift).
- **Impact:** Ensures sandboxed `vox run` execution works 100% out of the box on machines without Rust installed.

### 3. The `voxup` Omnibus Installer
Deprecate the direct OS package manager guides in favor of an omnibus bootstrap script (`curl https://vox-lang.org/voxup | sh`). Similar to `rustup`, `voxup` would:
- Install the `vox` binary.
- Fetch and configure hermetic, self-contained versions of mandatory dependencies (a minimal Node runtime, portable Git, WASI sysroots) into `~/.vox/toolchains/`.
- **Impact:** Guarantees a perfectly controlled, identical environment across all machines without polluting the user's global PATH or relying on their pre-existing OS packages.

### 4. Cloud Build Fallback (Zero-Dependency Mode)
For devices incapable of running heavy local toolchains (e.g., iPads, locked-down enterprise machines), `vox build` should automatically route native compilation or heavy ML tasks to the `vox-cloud` mesh.
- **Impact:** Complete hardware and toolchain independence.

## Next Steps

1. Update the `README.md` to explicitly state the toolchain prerequisites (Node.js, Rust) as a stopgap measure. *(Completed)*
2. Elevate **The Native Bundler Swap** to the active development sprint, as it removes the largest external dependency vector.
3. Design the `voxup` binary specification and test hermetic toolchain deployments on Windows, macOS, and Linux runners.
