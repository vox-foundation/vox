# Minimum Viable Corpus Size for QLoRA Domain Adaptation

A persistent operational hazard in the deployment of parameter-efficient fine-tuning is the assumption that modifying only a tiny fraction of a model's weights proportionately shrinks the required dataset volume.

**Evidence Strength:** High. Broad consensus across fine-tuning post-mortems and scaling law analyses (2024–2025).

## The < 500 Validated Pairs Threshold

Operating a fine-tuning cycle with fewer than 500 validated positive training pairs is empirically contraindicated for learning a novel domain-specific language.9 Post-mortem analyses of LLM fine-tuning failures explicitly highlight that parameter-efficient methods suffer from acute, accelerated catastrophic forgetting when the dataset size is too small.9

At the < 500 pairs threshold, the model is highly prone to catastrophic overfitting.9 The LLM will memorize the exact syntax of the few provided Vox code snippets rather than abstracting the underlying grammar and logic.49 Under these data-starved conditions, the gradients generated during backpropagation force the LoRA adapters to aggressively overwrite broad base-model representations simply to minimize the loss on the tiny target distribution.9 Research scaling laws for CF indicate that forgetting scales predictably with data insufficiency; a dataset size deficit of this magnitude almost guarantees the destruction of the model's generalized capabilities.9

## Saturation Guidelines and Threshold Gating

For QLoRA to successfully instill a new syntax or DSL without irrevocably damaging the base model, literature establishes strict volumetric parameters:

- **Minimum Viable Scale:** 1,000 to 5,000 high-quality, highly diverse examples are required simply to establish a recognizable pattern distribution without inducing catastrophic overfitting.49
- **Production Baseline:** 10,000 to 50,000 examples are required to achieve robust, reliable code generation in a completely novel syntax.49
- **Domain Expertise Capture:** Deep mastery of complex domain logic requires 50,000 to 500,000 examples.49

**Recommended action for Vox MENS:** If the system generates valid code slowly and cannot confidently validate more than 500 pairs per operational cycle, periodic QLoRA fine-tuning is the incorrect architectural choice. In ultra-low data regimes, the system should strictly utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Few-Shot prompting.64 RAG leverages the model's in-context learning capabilities, entirely bypassing gradient updates and the associated risks of CF, until sufficient data volume is aggregated to safely execute a fine-tuning epoch.64
