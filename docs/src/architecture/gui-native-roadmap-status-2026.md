## Phase 0 — Dashboard Safety

| Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| TASK-0.1 — ADR 024: Dashboard as Axum SPA | ✅ Done | `b7536331` | `docs/src/adr/024-dashboard-axum-spa.md` created. Index updated. |
| TASK-0.2 — Replace loopback-auto-unauth with token auth | ✅ Done | `bb72c7e3` | `token.rs` created. `DashboardToken::generate_or_load()` implemented. Meta-tag injection in `assets.rs`. |
| TASK-0.3 — Strict Origin/Host allowlist middleware | 🟡 Partial | `00588f6a` | Inline `check_origin_allowlist` closure in `mod.rs` (lines 287-316). Checks loopback origin/host. Missing: separate `origin_guard.rs` module, rejection body `{"error":"origin_denied"}`, WS-upgrade strict check, unit tests. |
| TASK-0.4 — CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, CORS | 🟡 Partial | `b7536331` | `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers present in `assets.rs`. CorsLayer not yet installed in gateway router. |
| TASK-0.5 — Fix `vox dashboard` CLI detachment + readiness polling | ✅ Done | `b7536331` | `DashboardLauncher` struct with `setsid()`/Windows `DETACHED_PROCESS` flags implemented. |
| TASK-0.6 — Harden `transport.ts`: backoff, auth refresh | 🟡 Partial | `b7536331` | Needs verification of backoff caps and `authStatus` event emission. |
| TASK-0.7 — Fix `App.tsx` hooks violation + dead imports | ✅ Done | `b7536331` | `useVoxTransport()` moved to top of component. Dead imports removed. |
| TASK-0.8 — Integration tests for dashboard crate | ❌ Not started | — | No test files under `crates/vox-dashboard/tests/`. |

**Phase 0 verdict:** 4 complete, 2 partial, 2 not started. TASK-0.3 is the critical blocker for security hardening.

## Phase 1 — Dashboard Cleanup

| Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| TASK-1.1 — Delete `vscode.ts` shim | ✅ Done | `b7536331` | `rg` finds zero `vscode.postMessage` or `getVsCodeApi` references. |
| TASK-1.2 — Fix or delete `vox-dashboard-d` binary | 🔲 Needs decision | — | Operator must choose Option A (delete) or Option B (make it work). |
| TASK-1.3 — `build.rs` for `include_dir!` safety + ETag | 🟡 Partial | `b7536331` | ETag support not yet confirmed. `build.rs` presence needs verification. |
| TASK-1.4 — Clean up `index.css` duplication | ❌ Not started | — | Stale hand-rolled Tailwind utilities still likely present. |
| TASK-1.5 — Pin workspace deps, remove `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` | ✅ Done | `b7536331` | `tower-http` uses `workspace = true`. `tsbuildinfo` removed and gitignored. |

**Phase 1 verdict:** 2 complete, 2 partial/decision-pending, 1 not started.

## Phase 2 — Compiler Primitive Collapse

| Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| TASK-2.1 — Delete Path B UI fields from `HirModule` | 🟡 Partial | `00588f6a` | `HirLoweringMigrationFlags` removed. `endpoint_fns` unified. However, `hir.components` field and usages still present in compiler (codegen_ts, web_ir/lower, typeck). Path B not fully purged. |
| TASK-2.2 — Unify `@server`/`@query`/`@mutation` → `@endpoint(kind: …)` | ✅ Done | `00588f6a` | `HirEndpointFn` with `EndpointKind` unified. `query_fns`/`mutation_fns`/`server_fns` collapsed to `endpoint_fns`. |
| TASK-2.3 — Collapse `HirExpr::DbTableOp` into `MethodCall` | ❌ Not started | — |  |
| TASK-2.4 — Resolve `HirExpr::Pipe` vs `Binary(Pipe)` | ❌ Not started | — |  |
| TASK-2.5 — Retire `http` bare-keyword routing | ❌ Not started | — |  |
| TASK-2.6 — Align `workflow`/`activity`/`actor` | ❌ Not started | — |  |

**Phase 2 verdict:** 1 complete, 1 partial, 4 not started. TASK-2.1 must be fully closed before Phase 3+ begin.

## Phase 3 — Grammar Unification Policy

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| TASK-3.1 — Add grammar unification rule to AGENTS.md | ❌ Not started | Depends on Phase 2. |

---

## Phases 4–8

All not started. Dependencies on Phases 2–3.

---

## Token / Clavis Status

`FORGE_TOKEN` is now stored in `~/.vox/auth.json` (local Clavis vault, **not
committed to the repo**). `vox ci watch-run` reads it automatically. No
more `$env:FORGE_TOKEN=...` prefix required for CI polling.

The `gho_*` token is a GitHub OAuth token scoped to your existing `gh` session.
It is **safe to store in Clavis** for local use — Clavis writes to
`~/.vox/auth.json` on your machine, never to the repository. You do NOT need
to generate a new PAT. The existing OAuth token is sufficient for the
`workflow` and `repo` scopes needed by `watch-run`.

---

## Immediate Next Tasks (in order)

1. **TASK-0.3 (finish)** — Extract inline origin check into proper `origin_guard.rs` with unit tests + JSON error body + WS-upgrade strict check.
2. **TASK-0.8** — Write integration tests for dashboard auth + asset serving.
3. **TASK-2.1 (finish)** — Remove remaining `hir.components` Path B field usages from `codegen_ts/emitter.rs`, `web_ir/lower.rs`, `typeck/checker/mod.rs`, `hir/validate.rs`.
4. **TASK-0.4 (finish)** — Install `CorsLayer` in gateway router.
5. **TASK-2.3** — Collapse `DbTableOp` variants.
