# Vox language feature maturity matrix (2026)

**Legend:** ✅ shipped / wired · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started / stub · **?** needs verification in tree.

Matrix is **aspirationally complete**; tighten cells with crate owners over time. Sources: [durability-runtime-audit-2026.md](durability-runtime-audit-2026.md), [gui-native-roadmap-status-2026.md](gui-native-roadmap-status-2026.md), mesh language spine plans.

## How to update

1. Pick a feature row; cite file:line or test name in a PR note.
2. If runtime is ⬜ but parse is ✅, add a warning to user-facing docs — See durability audit pattern.
3. Link new mesh/language tasks back to [mesh-phase1-language-spine-plan-2026.md](mesh-phase1-language-spine-plan-2026.md).
4. Follow [test-first policy](../../../AGENTS.md) when promoting a cell from ⬜ → ✅.
