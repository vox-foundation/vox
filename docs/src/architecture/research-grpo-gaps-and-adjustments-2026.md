# Gap Analysis and Recommended Architectural Adjustments

While the preceding analysis definitively identifies severe structural flaws in the proposed Vox MENS architecture, several areas require further empirical validation specific to its unique constraints:

1. **DSL-Specific Parse Mechanics and the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma:** The existing RLVR literature predominantly evaluates general-purpose programming languages such as Python, C++, and SQL.62 There is a pronounced lack of data regarding how a highly constrained Domain-Specific Language (DSL) impacts policy gradients. If the Vox DSL is extremely rigid with minimal syntax variations, the 60% syntax reward might mathematically saturate within the first 10 training steps, rendering it useless. Conversely, if the DSL is highly unintuitive, a heavy initial syntax reward might be a required "training wheel" to bootstrap exploration before being aggressively annealed.

2. **Dataset Scale Equivalencies in Group-Relative Methods:** The vast majority of RLVR studies evaluating GRPO utilize datasets ranging from 8,000 to 50,000 prompts (e.g., NuminaMath, APPS, LiveCodeBench).43 The mathematical stability of GRPO on a severely truncated, sparse dataset of fewer than 500 pairs is critically under-researched. It is highly probable that even with median-centering and heavy regularization, applying GRPO to a 500-pair dataset will result in catastrophic overfitting and dimension collapse within a single epoch.

3. **VRAM Accumulation over Extended Context Windows:** While GRPO mathematically eliminates the massive memory footprint of the value network, compiling code and executing AST coverage tools requires parsing long context windows (e.g., 8K to 16K+ tokens required for complex agentic workflows). The 16GB VRAM limit may still be shattered during the rollout generation phase due to Key-Value (KV) cache accumulation.64 The interplay between aggressive KV cache compression techniques and the off-policy mismatch it introduces into on-policy RL training remains an open, unresolved research gap.64

## Recommended Architectural Adjustments

Based on the rigorous synthesis of recent LLM reinforcement learning literature, the Vox MENS architecture requires fundamental realignment to succeed under its stated hardware and data constraints.

**1. Overhaul the Reward Scalarization (Implement Gating Mechanisms)**

- *Adjustment:* Abolish the 0.6 / 0.3 / 0.1 linear additive structure. Relying on a 60% baseline reward for syntax guarantees reward hacking and gradient stagnation.
- *Implementation:* Treat syntactic correctness not as an additive bonus, but as a **gating multiplier**. The reward function should be structured similarly to: $R = r\_{syntax} \times (w\_1 \cdot r\_{test} + w\_2 \cdot r\_{coverage})$. Under this formulation, if the code fails to parse ($r\_{syntax} = 0$), the entire reward is 0. This forces the model to achieve syntax correctness as an absolute baseline constraint without allowing it to substitute syntax for functional logic. Furthermore, significantly reduce or eliminate the weight of AST density to prevent Goodhart's Law, replacing it with a length-penalty to incentivize efficient, concise code execution.42

**2. Adopt DAPO Mechanics with Median-Centered Advantage Estimation**

- *Adjustment:* Vanilla GRPO with $k=8$ is statistically unstable. Upgrade the optimization algorithm to a hybrid of DAPO and MC-GRPO.
- *Implementation:* Eliminate the KL-divergence penalty to conserve VRAM and encourage unconstrained reasoning.23 Crucially, calculate the group baseline using the **median** of the 8 rollouts rather than the mean. This insulates the gradient updates from isolated, high-scoring reward hacks and prevents the advantage sign-flipping that plagues low-rollout regimes.31

**3. Unify the RL Objective (Abandon Positive-Only Updates)**

- *Adjustment:* Do not split invalid parses into a separate, disconnected SFT pipeline.
- *Implementation:* Ingest failed parses directly into the active RL loop as hard negative samples. Assign them a reward of $0$ (or a minor negative penalty). The GRPO advantage estimator will naturally calculate negative advantages for these trajectories, executing Negative Sample Reinforcement (NSR) that actively sculpts the model's decision boundaries away from syntax errors and hallucinations.57

**4. Mitigate the Sparse Dataset Constraint via Curriculum Generative Seeding**

- *Adjustment:* A dataset of 500 pairs is insufficient for RLVR convergence.
- *Implementation:* Leverage the base Qwen2.5-Coder model to synthesize mutated, increasingly difficult variations of the 500 pairs prior to RL training (Data Expansion).66 Implement an Anna Karenina sampling strategy to artificially balance the batch distribution with known negative trajectories drawn from the model's own rollouts. This maintains high policy entropy and prevents rapid saturation on the small dataset, sustaining the exploration necessary for functional code generation.59
