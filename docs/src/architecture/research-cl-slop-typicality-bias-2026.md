# The Risks of Agent-Generated Prose (Schola & Scientia)

The architectural inclusion of agent-generated "Schola" (educational content) and "Scientia" (publication summaries) into the training corpus alongside Vox code introduces severe volatility. The literature presents a stark warning against the indiscriminate ingestion of AI-generated prose.

**Evidence Strength:** Moderate to High. Expanding literature on "AI slop," typicality bias, and semantic homogenization (2024–2026).

## The Accumulation of "AI Slop"

Unlike compiled code, which possesses a strict, mathematical verification boundary (it either runs or it does not), natural language prose lacks a definitive, objective oracle.18 When a model recursively trains on unverified, agent-generated explanations and tutorials, it triggers a degenerative feedback loop referred to in recent literature as the accumulation of "AI slop".19

This degradation is mechanically driven by *typicality bias*.58 Language models naturally favor highly probable, stereotypical completions.58 When generating educational content, models lean toward bland, repetitive structural tropes (e.g., "It's not just X, it's Y," excessive use of em dashes, and generic summations).59 If this content is fed back into the fine-tuning corpus, the probability distribution sharpens artificially around these specific tropes, causing stylistic homogenization and completely erasing the richness, nuance, and distributional tails associated with human-authored prose.19

Furthermore, without a deterministic feedback loop to intercept logical errors in the prose, the system is prone to *semantic hallucination*.18 In a technical context, this means the agent-generated Schola documentation may hallucinate APIs, Vox language features, or best practices that do not actually exist.61 The model will subsequently train on its own fabrications, embedding systemic confabulations deeply into its parameters.61

## Engineering High-Fidelity Synthetic Corpora

If agent-generated prose must be included in the flywheel, it cannot be raw. The success of models trained extensively on synthetic educational content—such as the Phi series and Cosmopedia—relied heavily on the elimination of low-quality "slop."

The Vox MENS architecture must deploy a secondary, independent "Curator LLM" (preferably a highly capable, API-accessible frontier model) specifically prompted to detect and discard typicality bias, structural repetition, and logical inconsistencies.58 The curator must enforce a strict semantic entropy threshold, rejecting explanations that lack grounded factual consistency.6

Furthermore, treating agentic documentation generation as a multi-step process—where reasoning traces are generated separately from the final prose inference—substantially improves the factual faithfulness of the synthetic output prior to its ingestion into the training corpus.62
