# AI Fixtures TS Lowering Follow-on (2026)

This follow-on tracks TypeScript codegen parity for AI fixture variants currently surfaced as:

- `vox/codegen/missing-ts-ai-lowering`

Scope (future):

1. Map `HirAiFixture::{Prompt,Subagent,Search,Hole,IntentRouted}` to TS runtime shims.
2. Define TS-safe ACI envelope helpers and fixture telemetry sinks.
3. Add parity tests against Rust fixture codegen snapshots.
