# GRPO Reward Shaping for Code LLMs

## Executive Summary

The transition from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Reinforcement Learning represents the definitive frontier in post-training LLMs for code generation. The Vox MENS architecture seeks to leverage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a 7B-parameter code-generation model under strict 16 GB VRAM constraints (NVIDIA RTX 4080 class). The composite scalar reward is calculated as `0.45 × r_syntax + 0.25 × r_test + 0.10 × r_coverage + 0.20 × r_routing_efficiency` across a sample group of k=8 at temperature 0.8.

The overarching empirical consensus is that while GRPO is architecturally justified over PPO for eliminating the value network and reducing VRAM overhead, the specific reward function and sampling parameters introduce critical, potentially catastrophic failure modes. Historically, assigning 60% weight to binary syntactic correctness created a pathological optimization landscape that actively disincentivized complex problem-solving. By integrating `r_routing_efficiency` (based on Network Neuroscience Theory small-world topologies), the reward signal is smoothed, encouraging the model to self-organize efficient, tight executor-verifier clusters and penalizing redundant long-range orchestrator hops. However, k=8 on a sparse dataset still risks extreme gradient variance and advantage sign flipping.
