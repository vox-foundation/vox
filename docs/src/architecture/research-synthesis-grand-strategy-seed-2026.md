# Research Synthesis: Grand Strategy Seed (April 2026)

This document serves as the "plan to make the plan." It indexes the nine Gemini Deep Research output documents collected in April 2026 and provides the primary strategic scaffolding. It identifies how the disparate findings from GRPO training, agent trust metrics, multi-agent economics, testing frameworks, and continual learning directly inform a cohesive "Grand Implementation Strategy" for Vox.

## The Nine Research Foundations

The research tracks are organized into three clusters, mapping tightly to our risk posture:

### Cluster A: Evaluating Legacy Assumptions 
*Challenging heuristic or unempirical decisions in our current architecture.*
1. **[GRPO Reward Shaping](research-grpo-reward-shaping-2026.md):** Re-evaluating the 0.6/0.3/0.1 parse/test/coverage reward split. Foundational for ensuring Vox MENS training doesn't optimize for syntactic vanity metics over semantic correctness.
2. **[Agent Trust Reliability Evaluation](research-trust-reliability-signals-2026.md):** Auditing the EWMA + Laplace smoothing trust rollups to ensure stable, mathematically sound agent routing.
3. **[AI Plan Adequacy Heuristics](research-plan-adequacy-heuristics-2026.md):** Validating whether word-count and naive complexity proxies actually predict plan success, or if they need to be replaced with LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms.

### Cluster B: Known Gaps & Improvement Vectors
*Designing implementations for high-priority missing pieces.*
4. **[LLM Grammar Constraints](research-grammar-constrained-decoding-2026.md):** Assessing GBNF vs. XGrammar for FSA-based constrained decoding to eliminate syntax errors dynamically via logit-masking.
5. **[AI Agent Context and Handoff](research-context-handoff-continuity-2026.md):** Solving session continuity and context drift across multi-agent handoffs, and establishing standard 'ContextEnvelopes'.
6. **[Compiler Testing Research](research-pbt-oracles-compiled-lang-2026.md):** Implementing property-based testing and solving the "oracle problem" for the custom Vox compiler.

### Cluster C: Frontier Unknowns
*Navigating the trailing edge of AI research related to Vox's specific goals.*
7. **[LLM-Native Language Design](research-llm-native-lang-design-2026.md):** Aggregating empirical evidence validating that strict typing effectively reduces LLM hallucination rates by heavily constraining the output space.
8. **[Multi-Agent Mesh Economics](research-multi-agent-mesh-economics-2026.md):** Projecting context and token overhead costs of decomposing work across an agent network.
9. **[Continual Learning Flywheel Risks](research-continual-learning-flywheel-2026.md):** Identifying catastrophic forgetting mitigations when a model continually trains on self-generated code loops.

## The Strategic Sequence (Future Blueprints)

These documents form the knowledge base. We will spawn the following **Implementation Blueprints** sequentially, directly grounded in this research:

1. **The MENS RL Re-Alignment Blueprint:**
   Synthesizes [A1] and [C3] to architect a safe QLoRA/GRPO pipeline that penalizes "structure snowballing" while protecting against catastrophic base-model collapse during the continuous dogfood loop.
2. **The OOPAV Orchestration Blueprint:**
   Synthesizes [A2], [A3], [B2], and [C2] to rewrite the orchestrator plane. This will lock in EWMA parameters based on sample rates, enforce standard `ContextEnvelope` passing during agent delegation, and build sub-agent circuit breakers.
3. **The Vox Trust Context & Constraint Blueprint:**
   Synthesizes [B1], [B3], and [C1] to wrap the Vox language. We will expose compiler feedback instantly to the agent, implement strict constraint decoding, and build property-guided LLM-as-a-judge tests to harden semantic output.

## Next Steps

This seed document and the nine referenced markdown files represent the completion of the *Research Gathering* phase. Before executing the future implementation blueprints listed above, the engineering team must formally propose the Blueprint ADRs matching this alignment trajectory.
