# Vox A2A Orchestration Hardening Findings 2026 (April)

This document synthesizes the findings and implementation results from the April 2026 hardening wave focused on Vox Agent-to-Agent (A2A) orchestration.

## 1. Resilience against Infinite Loops (Supervisor Arbitration)

### Findings
Without active termination, agent handoff protocols are susceptible to infinite recursive bounces (A -> B -> A) during high-uncertainty tasks. These loops consume significant financial and computational resources and pollute the session context.

### Implementation Result
- **MAX_A2A_BOUNCE**: Enforced a hard limit of `5` bounces per task.
- **Queue Suppression**: The orchestrator now actively rejects handoffs that exceed the iteration depth, failing the task with a `LoopDetected` status.
- **Telemetry**: surfaced `handoff_count` in the `OrchestratorStatus` and indexed it into the DEI IDE visualizer.

## 2. Durable Workflow Journals (Resumption & Audit)

### Findings
In-memory task state is volatile across daemon restarts. While the memory shard provides local persistence, it lacks the temporal granularity required for high-fidelity audit or reconstruction if the state object itself is corrupted or lost.

### Implementation Result
- **Research Metrics Integration**: Agent reasoning (turns) are now recorded asynchronously to the `research_metrics` table in `vox-db`.
- **Automatic Hydration**: The orchestrator now performs a `hydrate_all_tasks_from_journal` pass during database attachment (`init_db`), ensuring transcripts are reconstructed automatically after session interruptions.
- **Precedence Policy**: Local memory state is prioritized; the journal acts as a "resuscitation" fallback if local history is missing or shorter than the durable log.

## 3. Surgical Context Injection (Mitigating "Lost in the Middle")

### Findings
Injecting a full, multi-agent transcript into every prompt causes "context sprawl," increasing latency and frequently triggering model identity confusion or identity smuggling. 

### Implementation Result
- **Rolling Transcript**: `AgentTask` now maintains a `transcript: Vec<TaskTurn>` (capped at 10 items).
- **Injection Window**: The `AiTaskProcessor` was updated to inject only the **last 3 turns** into the prompt. This provides sufficient reasoning continuity for the recipient agent while preserving the "Lost in the Middle" attention span for the current objective.
- **Identity Isolation**: By using structured `TaskTurn` objects rather than raw text blocks, we enforce a clean boundary between agent personas.

## 4. Visual Ergonomics & Transparency

### Findings
Operators were unable to distinguish between a "hard task" and a "looping task" in the visualizer without manual inspection of the session log.

### Implementation Result
- **Telemetry Indicators**: Added `max_handoff_count` to the `vox_orchestrator_status` tool.
- **Markdown Encoding**: The IDE summary now displays `[Bounce: N]` per agent and a global `Peak Bounce Depth` metric, allowing at-a-glance identification of recursive chains.

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Socrates Bridge**: Finalize the integration of the `transcript` into the Hallucination Detection gate.
2. **Transcript Compaction**: Implement summarization for turns 4-10 to prevent long-term context decay.
3. **Capability-Based Handoffs**: Add access control lists (ACLs) to the handoff protocol to prevent unauthorized agent delegation.
