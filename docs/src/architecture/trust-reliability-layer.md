# Trust Reliability Layer (SSOT)

This document defines the current trust/reliability architecture used by orchestrator routing, Socrates telemetry, endpoint reliability, and downstream analytics.

## Why this exists

The codebase historically had multiple trust-like signals that were useful but partially disconnected:

- `agent_reliability` (Laplace-smoothed task outcomes)
- in-memory `AgentTrustScore` (attention/approval behavior)
- endpoint EWMA metrics (`endpoint_reliability`)
- Socrates turn telemetry (`socrates_surface`)
- file-based MENS/eval artifacts

The unified trust layer adds a common vocabulary and persistence model so these signals can be queried and used together.

## Canonical trust vocabulary

Trust observations are recorded as:

- `entity_type`: `agent`, `endpoint`, `model`, `skill`, `workflow`, `repository`, `evidence_bundle`
- `entity_id`: stable identifier for the entity
- `dimension`: e.g. `task_completion`, `factuality`, `contradiction_rate`, `refusal_propensity`, `latency_reliability`
- `scope`: `domain`, `task_class`, `provider`, `model_id`, `repository_id`
- value + confidence: `observation_value`, `confidence_weight`, `sample_size`
- provenance: `source_kind`, `artifact_ref`, `metadata_json`, `created_at_ms`

## Storage model

Two database tables are the SSOT:

- `trust_observations`: append-only evidence log for replay/audit.
- `trust_rollups`: materialized scoped rollups keyed by `(entity_type, entity_id, dimension, scope...)`.

Current implementation:

- each observation is inserted into `trust_observations`
- each insert updates `trust_rollups.score` with EWMA
- rollups retain `sample_size`, `ewma_alpha`, and `updated_at_ms`

## Runtime producers

Current producers that write into the trust layer:

- orchestrator task completion/failure writes `agent` + `task_completion` observations
- endpoint reliability writes `endpoint` observations for factuality/contradiction/infra dimensions
- Socrates surface telemetry writes `model` observations for factuality/contradiction/refusal dimensions

## Runtime consumers

Current consumers:

- routing uses scoped `agent` `task_completion` trust rollups as floor + weighted utility
- `vox db reliability-list --domain trust` shows trust rollups for operators
- MCP `vox_db_trust_rollups` lists scoped rollup rows; `vox_db_trust_summary` returns grouped aggregates (by dimension, domain, entity type, or combined keys); `vox_db_trust_drift` compares recent vs prior window means on raw observations; `vox_db_trust_propagate` runs domain-clique affinity smoothing over model rollups (optional persist to `*_propagated` dimensions)
- `vox ci mens-scorecard ingest-trust --summary <path>` ingests a validated `vox_mens_scorecard_summary_v1` `summary.json` into `trust_observations` / rollups for the workspace repository id
- `vox_scientia_worthiness_evaluate` with `with_live_trust: true` attaches `live_trust_rollups` summaries for the workspace repository when VoxDb is connected

## Notes on score semantics

`trust_rollups.score` is normalized to `[0, 1]` and interpreted as “higher is better”.

- For inverse-risk metrics, writers invert before recording (`1 - risk`).
- `dimension` names can represent the source signal, but stored score remains normalized-goodness.

## Known gaps (next iterations)

- extend domain tagging and policy-profile attribution beyond primary MCP chat/plan/edit surfaces
- automated calibration transforms (e.g. isotonic) on top of drift reports—not only windowed mean comparison
- richer graph propagation than same-domain clique affinity (explicit trust edges, provider graphs)
