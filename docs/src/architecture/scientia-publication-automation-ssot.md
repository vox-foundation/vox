## SCIENTIA publication automation SSOT

This is the primary SSOT for turning Vox/Populi findings into publishable scientific artifacts quickly, safely, and reproducibly.

Scope:

- direct publication and self-archival paths (`arXiv`, Zenodo-style deposition, Crossref-grade metadata),
- journal submission readiness (`JMLR`, `TMLR`, `JAIR`, major publisher AI policies),
- Vox-native orchestration (`vox-orchestrator`, Populi mesh, Socrates, eval gates, SCIENTIA manifest lifecycle).

## North-star outcome

Minimize time from validated finding to submission-ready package while preserving:

- epistemic integrity (no fabricated claims/citations/data),
- reproducibility (before/after evidence with replayability),
- policy compliance (journal, ethics, AI disclosure, metadata quality),
- provenance (digest-bound state transitions and auditable pipeline decisions).

## Source anchors

## Scientia package-family topology

To avoid `vox-publisher` becoming a god-object crate, the Scientia namespace is split into
package boundaries:

- `vox-scientia-core`: publication manifest, preflight, worthiness, metadata/evidence modeling.
- `vox-scientia-social`: channel syndication DTOs/outcomes and social adapter surface.
- `vox-scientia-runtime`: runtime composition boundary for orchestrator-facing flows.
- `vox-scientia-api`: API composition boundary for CLI/MCP surfaces.

`vox-publisher` remains as a compatibility shim while downstream imports migrate.

## Vox capability map for publication automation

### Already usable now

- SCIENTIA canonical manifest lifecycle with digest-bound approvals and submission ledger.
- Structured scholarly metadata in `metadata_json.scientific_publication`.
- Preflight checks with readiness score, profile-aware gating, consolidated `manual_required` / `confidence`, and ordered `next_actions`; CLI/MCP status surfaces now embed the same checklist so operators can keep one default attention surface open.
- Syndication hydrate accepts canonical `metadata_json.syndication`, legacy `scientia_distribution`, and contract `channels`/`channel_payloads` normalization; Twitter uses the same retry budget machinery as other HTTP adapters; `publication-retry-failed` skips channels already marked `Success` for the current digest.
- Scholarly adapters already include `local_ledger`, `echo_ledger`, `zenodo`, and `openreview`, while arXiv remains operator-assist via staging export + handoff events.
- Zenodo deposition metadata JSON generation.
- MCP/CLI parity for core prepare/approve/submit/status and preflight.
- Socrates anti-hallucination telemetry and gate concepts.
- `metadata_json.scientia_evidence` (see `vox_publisher::scientia_evidence`): optional Socrates rollup (merged from VoxDb when using preflight `--with-worthiness`), eval-gate snapshot, benchmark baseline/candidate pair, and human attestations; folded into `publication_worthiness` scoring with manifest preflight heuristics.

### Reusable orchestration/mesh assets

- A2A messaging and handoff payloads for reviewer-style multi-agent workflows.
- Populi coordination patterns (distributed lock, heartbeats, conflict paths).
- Reliability and benchmark telemetry pathways for publication KPIs.

### Non-automatable or human-accountability-critical steps

- final claims and novelty significance assertion,
- ethical risk acceptance and framing,
- legal/publisher final attestation steps,
- submission authorization where account liability is personal/institutional.

## Before/after benchmark protocol (publication-grade)

Required evidence pair per claim:

1. `baseline_run` and `candidate_run` with immutable run IDs and repository context.
2. Identical benchmark manifest and policy profile.
3. Captured outputs:
   - eval JSON,
   - gate JSON,
   - telemetry summary,
   - manifest digest,
   - environment and dependency fingerprints.
4. Reported delta set:
   - effect size,
   - confidence/variance window or repeated-run stability proxy,
   - failure-mode deltas (not only headline wins).
5. Publishability condition:
   - no regression in critical safety/quality gates unless explicitly justified and approved.

## Gap priorities and solutions

### Gap 1: package builder and venue profiles (complex)

- **Where:** `vox-publisher` has metadata/preflight but no camera-ready package builder.
- **Why:** manual packaging dominates cycle time and introduces policy errors.
- **Minimum viable fix:** add `SubmissionPackageBuilder` with profiles `jmlr`, `tmlr`, `jair`, `arxiv`; emit deterministic archive manifest.
- **Expanded solution (how/where/when/why):**
  - add `crates/vox-publisher/src/submission/mod.rs` with profile-specific validators;
  - wire CLI/MCP commands `publication-package-build` and `publication-package-validate`;
  - persist package artifact metadata in publication tables with digest linkage;
  - run compile/format checks and include machine-readable report in manifest metadata.
- **Success criteria:** >=95% package validation pass in CI dry-runs before human submission.

### Gap 2: operator routing still dominates more than it should (medium)

- **Where:** the code already has multiple adapters, but the user still has to think in terms of low-level surfaces (`preflight`, approvals, pipeline, status, social simulation, retry).
- **Why:** time is still lost on choosing the right command sequence rather than following one obvious happy path.
- **Minimum viable fix:** standardize on `publication-preflight` / `publication-status` as the checklist surfaces and `publication-scholarly-pipeline-run` as the default scholarly path.
- **Expanded solution:**
  - keep low-level commands, but lead docs and MCP/CLI outputs with ordered `next_actions`;
  - make `publication-status` the persistent operator checklist for approvals, worker outcomes, and retries;
  - keep adapter work focused on hard gaps (`Crossref`, journal portals) instead of inventing a new orchestration layer.
- **Success criteria:** a new operator can follow one obvious scholarly path without reconstructing the command graph from docs.

### Gap 3: anti-slop policy gate depth (medium)

- **Where:** current preflight catches core checks but not full anti-slop taxonomy.
- **Why:** fabricated or weakly supported science can still pass narrow checks.
- **Minimum viable fix:** add citation resolvability + claim-evidence linkage completeness checks.
- **Expanded solution:** integrate Socrates outputs as hard publication predicates for factual claims.
- **Success criteria:** zero unresolved fabricated-reference incidents in internal publication trials.

### Gap 4: benchmark provenance unification (complex)

- **Where:** benchmarks, Mens/Populi artifacts, and publication manifests are not fully unified.
- **Why:** difficult to prove reproducibility and before/after integrity at publication time.
- **Minimum viable fix:** define a single `EvidencePack` schema and attach to manifest metadata.
- **Expanded solution:** orchestrated evidence pack builder pulls eval/gate/telemetry + commit/env fingerprints and signs report digest.
- **Success criteria:** every publication candidate has a complete evidence pack with replay instructions.

### Gap 5: worthiness classification consistency (medium)

- **Where:** no dedicated publishability rubric in SSOT form.
- **Why:** inconsistent decisions about what is scientifically worthy.
- **Minimum viable fix:** adopt explicit `Publish/AskForEvidence/Abstain` rubric with numeric thresholds.
- **Expanded solution:** policy engine consuming worthiness metrics and producing deterministic decision traces.
- **Success criteria:** decision disagreement rate between reviewers and rubric <15% after calibration period.

## KPI set for this SSOT

- `submission_readiness_score`
- `metadata_completeness_rate`
- `evidence_pack_completeness_rate`
- `policy_gate_pass_rate`
- `time_to_submission_ms`
- `adapter_submission_success_rate`
- `revision_turnaround_ms`
- `socrates_contradiction_ratio_for_publishables`

## Decision policy

This architecture SSOT defines pipeline shape, boundaries, and implementation priorities; the rules doc defines scientific-worthiness classification and hard red lines.

## Scientia social distribution (2026)

Scientia publication manifests should use `metadata_json.syndication` for
cross-channel routing metadata and policy. Canonical schema artifacts:

- `contracts/scientia/distribution.schema.json`
- `contracts/scientia/distribution.default.yaml`
- `contracts/scientia/distribution.topic-packs.yaml`
- `contracts/scientia/social-execution-board.template.yaml`
- `contracts/scientia/social-execution-board.generated.yaml`

Platform constraints and automation boundaries:

- Reddit: Data API/OAuth with `submit` scope and strict User-Agent policy.
- Hacker News: official API remains read-only; use manual-assist submit links.
- YouTube: `videos.insert` requires OAuth user flow and quota budgeting; unverified projects are private-only until audit-approved.

Required controls for live distribution:

- digest-bound approvals remain mandatory,
- per-channel attempts are ledgered in `publication_attempts`,
- retries follow explicit profile budgets (no unbounded retry loops),
- secrets are resolved through env/keyring/auth fallback precedence and never embedded into manifest payloads,
- channel routing decisions honor topic filters and per-channel worthiness floors when configured.

Distribution precedence:

1. explicit per-item manifest/channel overrides,
2. `metadata_json.syndication.distribution_policy.channel_policy`,
3. orchestrator runtime/env overrides for live operations.
