# Utilizing Parse Failures as Negative Examples

The proposal to ingest parse failures and type errors as negative training examples (split=negative) represents an advanced and highly promising training methodology. Historically, autonomous agent-tuning pipelines simply discarded failed trajectories, resulting in massive data waste and limiting the model's understanding of failure boundaries.44

**Evidence Strength:** Moderate/Emerging. Promising results in recent RL and preference optimization literature (2024–2026).

## Negative-Aware Training (NAT)

Recent literature validates the concept of "Negative-Aware Training" (NAT).67 By retaining unsuccessful code trajectories, the model is provided with explicit examples of what constitutes invalid syntax. Operationally, this requires appending explicit instructional prefixes or suffixes to the invalid data (e.g., "The following code contains a syntactic error:").67 Providing the actual compiler error trace alongside the failed code acts as a dense, localized reward signal, significantly improving the model's inductive reasoning regarding the execution states and constraints of the Vox language.69

## Preference Optimization Frameworks

Rather than standard supervised fine-tuning, negative splits are optimally utilized via preference optimization frameworks. Techniques such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or the recently proposed Consensus-Driven DPO (Con-DPO) natively accommodate positive/negative pairs.44 By contrasting the successful compilation attempt against the failed parse attempt, the model explicitly learns the delta between correct and incorrect logic.44

**Important constraint:** Negative samples must be carefully balanced with positive samples during batching; an over-representation of failures can cause the model to become overly conservative or induce degenerate outputs.72
