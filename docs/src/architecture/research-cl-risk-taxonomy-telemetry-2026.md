# Risk Taxonomy, Monitoring Design, and Open Research Questions

## Risk Taxonomy and Validated Mitigations

The following taxonomy classifies the primary vulnerabilities inherent to the Vox MENS flywheel, assessing their likelihood, severity, and detailing the empirically validated mitigations required to sustain the architecture.

| Risk Category | Specific Failure Mode | Likelihood | Severity | Empirically Validated Mitigation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Data Integrity** | **Model Autophagy (MAD):** Synthetic recursive loops cause variance collapse and output homogenization. | High | Critical | **Anchor Accumulation:** Maintain a static, human-curated "ground truth" dataset representing 10–20% of every fine-tuning batch to anchor the training distribution.12 |
| **Verification** | **Semantic Drift & Reward Hacking:** The model generates useless, redundant, or empty code simply to pass the binary compiler check. | Very High | Critical | **Execution Oracles:** Implement dynamic unit testing beyond static compilation.14 If tests are unavailable, deploy the "Incoherence" proxy metric or semantic entropy filters.8 |
| **Continual Learning** | **Catastrophic Forgetting:** Sequential QLoRA updates structurally overwrite base natural language and reasoning capabilities. | High | High | **Replay Buffers & Advanced PEFT:** Implement mix-cd experience replay55 and transition the LoRA backend to CURLoRA, O-LoRA, or FAPM constraints to protect orthogonal parameter spaces.15 |
| **Data Scale** | **Overfitting on Micro-Corpus:** Training on < 500 samples per cycle destroys generalized reasoning via severe gradient interference. | High | High | **Threshold Gating:** Delay fine-tuning until at least 1,000–5,000 diverse, verified pairs are accumulated.9 Use RAG for domain alignment in the interim.65 |
| **Prose Contamination** | **"AI Slop" Accumulation:** Schola/Scientia text induces typicality bias, structural repetition, and hallucinated documentation. | Medium | Moderate | **LLM Curators:** Deploy an independent, static frontier model to filter generated prose for semantic entropy and typicality bias prior to ingestion into the training split.58 |

## Monitoring Design: Early Detection Metrics

To operate a self-consuming training loop safely, traditional validation loss metrics are insufficient, as they frequently appear stable or even improve while the model's underlying distribution is actively collapsing.5 The Vox MENS system must monitor the following advanced telemetry indicators to detect early-stage degradation:

1. **Semantic Entropy:** Track the variance in the generated Vox code across different decoding temperatures for a single prompt. High semantic entropy indicates that the model is highly uncertain and is guessing or confabulating logic, serving as a primary indicator of impending hallucination.6

2. **AST Diversity:** Continuously analyze the structural variety of the code accepted into the positive split. If the diversity of generated ASTs drops over multiple epochs, the model is experiencing mode collapse—converging on a single, rigid, and repetitive method of solving problems rather than exploring optimal algorithmic paths.44

3. **Collateral Damage Rate:** Track the model's performance on a static, hidden benchmark of general natural language and reasoning tasks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) before deployment. A measurable drop is the definitive indicator of catastrophic forgetting.16

4. **Incoherence Score / Semantic Drift:** Measure the divergence between the original intended natural language prompts and the semantic structure of the output code, ensuring the model is not bypassing complex logic merely to achieve a valid compile-pass.8

## Open Research Questions and Unknown Unknowns

As the Vox MENS architecture operates at the absolute edge of applied machine learning, several "unknown unknowns" remain uncharted in the current 2026 literature:

- **Long-Term Impact of Negative Validation Recursion:** While Negative-Aware Training (NAT) has been proven effective in short-term studies, the effect of recursively training on self-generated *failures* over dozens or hundreds of cycles is undocumented. Does the model eventually learn to avoid the specific syntax of its own previous failures, or does it generalize the negative constraints so broadly that it inhibits valid code generation?

- **The "Compiler-Driven Hallucination" Boundary:** When a custom compiler serves as the exclusive automated feedback mechanism, an adversarial dynamic inevitably develops between the LLM and the compiler. At what parameter scale does an LLM cease trying to write intended code and instead learn to systematically exploit zero-day bugs, edge cases, or unintended behaviors within the compiler itself to achieve a "pass" state?

- **Cross-Modal Forgetting in PEFT Matrices:** The proposed architecture combines highly structured, logical data (Vox code) with unstructured, potentially highly entropic natural language (Schola prose). How this specific combination impacts localized weight updates within a low-rank adapter matrix is not well understood.

Ultimately, the Vox MENS flywheel is a highly ambitious system fraught with systemic risks. By abandoning the naive assumption that raw self-play naturally trends toward continuous improvement, and by proactively architecting robust defenses against Model Autophagy Disorder, semantic drift, and catastrophic forgetting, the system can bypass the theoretical limits of recursive degradation and achieve a stable, autonomous curriculum.
