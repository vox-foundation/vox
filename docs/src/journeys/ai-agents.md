# Journey: Building Resilient AI Agents

## The Broken Reality of Orchestrating LLMs

Building an intelligent AI agent generally involves duct-taping language models to your application state. This requires writing brittle Python scripts or complex TypeScript orchestrators like Langchain.

As soon as your agent needs to execute a tool reliably, parse JSON tool-call responses, retry failures, and maintain a stateful memory of the interaction, the infrastructure complexity explodes. LLMs hallucinate arguments, drop nested fields, and break your application logic.

## The Vox Paradigm: Built-In, Type-Safe Orchestration

Vox was explicitly designed as an AI-native programming language. You do not need an external orchestration library to build an agent, because Vox natively generates Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool schemas and natively coordinates stateful LLM queries.

In Vox, the chaos of generative models is bounded by the compiler's zero-null guarantees (`Result` and `Option`). You define the rigid boundaries; Vox handles the plumbing.

## Core Snippet: Creating an Agent Tool

By adding a single decorator—`@mcp.tool`— Vox parses the docstring, the types, and the return structure, turning your server function into a ready-to-execute schema for your LLM.

```vox
// vox:skip
// This feature is partially implemented.
type SearchResult {
    Found { text: str, score: int }
    NotFound { query: str }
}

@mcp.tool "Search the knowledge base for documents matching the query"
fn search_knowledge(query: str, max_results: int) -> SearchResult {
    let hits = db.vector_search(query, max_results)
    if hits.len() == 0 {
        return NotFound { query: query }
    }
    return Found { text: hits[0].text, score: hits[0].score }
}

@server 
fn get_answer(user_question: str) -> Result[str] {
    let answer = agent.query(user_question, { tools: [search_knowledge] })
    return Ok(answer)
}
```

## Running the Process

1. Save the above snippet into an entrypoint like `src/agent.vox`.
2. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   vox build src/agent.vox
   vox run src/agent.vox
   ```

3. Vox will start the development server. The endpoints become immediately queryable, and if running in MCP mode, your agent tools are automatically broadcasted for discovery.

## Maturity and limitations

- **Maturity:** `beta` for decorator-shaped `@mcp.tool` examples — compiler and MCP registry paths evolve; treat snippets as orientation, not a guarantee every field matches shipped schemas.
- **Limitation ids:** [L-001](../../../contracts/journeys/limitations.v1.yaml) (docs may oversell partial `@mcp` surfaces), [L-023](../../../contracts/journeys/limitations.v1.yaml) (MCP tool registry parity is ongoing maintenance).

## Deep Dives
