# Example: Vox Workflow Example

```vox
# Vox Workflow Example
# Demonstrates durable workflows with steps, retries, and activity calls.
#
# Workflows are long-running, fault-tolerant execution graphs.
# Each step is durably recorded so execution survives crashes.
# Activities are retryable async operations called within workflows.

# An activity that fetches data from an external API.
# Activities are the only place for side effects in workflows.
activity fetch_user_data(user_id: str) to Result[str]:
    # This would call an external API in production
    ret Ok("User data for " + user_id)

# An activity that sends a notification email.
# The `with` expression configures retry and timeout behavior.
activity send_notification(email: str, body: str) to Result[bool]:
    # External email service call
    ret Ok(true)

# A multi-step onboarding workflow.
#
# If the process crashes after step 1, it will resume at step 2
# when restarted. This is "durable execution" — no work is lost.
workflow onboard_user(user_id: str, email: str) to Result[str]:
    # Step 1: Fetch user profile
    let profile = fetch_user_data(user_id) with { retries: 3, timeout: "30s" }

    # Step 2: Send welcome email
    let _ = send_notification(email, "Welcome! " + profile) with { retries: 5, timeout: "60s" }

    # Step 3: Return success
    ret Ok("Onboarding complete for " + user_id)

# Entry point
fn main():
    let result = onboard_user("usr_123", "alice@example.com")
    ret result
```
