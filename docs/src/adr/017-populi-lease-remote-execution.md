# ADR 017: Populi lease-based authoritative remote execution

## Status

**Accepted (design intent).** This ADR records the **intended** execution-ownership model for Populi remote work. Until implementation and contract updates land, shipped behavior remains **local-first** with **experimental** best-effort relay only (see [ADR 008 addendum](008-populi-transport.md#addendum-experimental-orchestrator-routing-in-process-only) and [mens SSOT](../reference/populi.md)).

## Context

Populi already provides membership, HTTP control plane operations, and A2A inbox semantics including **claimer leases** for mesh-delivered rows ([mens SSOT](../reference/populi.md)). The orchestrator can emit **best-effort** [`RemoteTaskEnvelope`](../../../crates/vox-orchestrator/src/a2a/envelope.rs) traffic when experimental flags are set, but **local queues still own execution** today.

The first-wave **personal-cluster** roadmap needs a clear upgrade path from relay-style fan-out to **authoritative** remote ownership so that:

- at most **one** worker owns execution of a given leased task class at a time,
- long-running GPU work can **renew** leases and handle **cancellation** predictably,
- **partition or expiry** yields a defined **local fallback** (or explicit failure) rather than silent double execution.

## Decision

1. **Authoritative remote execution v1** uses a **single-owner lease** recorded by the Populi control plane (or equivalent durable coordinator): exactly one remote worker holds the lease for a given **task / correlation id** until **release**, **expiry**, **revocation**, or **verified handoff** (if ever added later).
2. **Transport for handoff, renew, cancel, and result correlation** remains **A2A over the Populi HTTP control plane** unless a future ADR replaces [ADR 008](008-populi-transport.md) as the default control transport. Lease **state** may also be exposed via additive HTTP APIs as contracts evolve.
3. **No work-stealing in v1:** the scheduler does not preempt an active lease holder for another peer without an explicit future design.
4. **Local fallback** is **required** for the leased task class when lease acquisition fails, renewal fails, the worker is unhealthy, or the lease expires without completion—unless operator policy explicitly opts into fail-closed behavior for that profile (documented per deployment).
5. **Promotion trigger:** shipping behavior where **remote execution correctness** or **SLA** depends on Populi (not merely “extra logging” or “hinting”) is a **breaking adoption** of this ADR and must be accompanied by contract tests, rollout docs, and updates to [mens SSOT](../reference/populi.md) and [unified orchestration](../reference/orchestration-unified.md).

## Non-goals (this ADR)

- Default **WAN distributed training** or collective-heavy schedules.
- Hosted multi-tenant GPU **donation** networks ([ADR 009](009-populi-hosted-baas.md) remains the future-scope boundary).
- Merging `remote_mesh` durability semantics with `local_durable` queue ownership without a separate ADR.

## Consequences

- Experimental relay flags remain **best-effort** and **non-authoritative** until implementation aligns with this ADR.
- New **OpenAPI** fields and orchestrator **gating** are expected to be **additive** and **off by default** during rollout.
- Operators gain a stable vocabulary: **lease grant / renew / release / expiry**, **correlation id**, **single owner**, **fallback**.
