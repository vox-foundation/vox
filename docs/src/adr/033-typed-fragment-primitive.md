# ADR 033: Typed parametric fragment primitive

## Status

Accepted (2026-05-03). Phase F shipped end-to-end across two commits in the same session:

- Lexer `Token::Fragment` + `Display` arm, AST `FragmentDecl` and `Decl::Fragment` variant, parser dispatch in [parser/descent/mod.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/mod.rs) and `parse_fragment_decl` in [parser/descent/decl/head.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/decl/head.rs) (commit `6f01b8ae1`).
- HIR `HirFragmentDecl` node + AST→HIR lowering in [hir/lower/mod.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/hir/lower/mod.rs) and `emit_fragment_decls` in [codegen_ts/fragment_emit.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/fragment_emit.rs) producing typed React function components in `fragments.tsx` with `<Name>Args` prop interfaces, wired into `emitter::generate` (commit `2227e3026`).

The Phase 6 (TASK-6.1) typed semantic primitive surface landed on `main` during the same session merge cycle, so the codegen gate originally noted here cleared without a second migration. Open questions in §"Open questions" remain follow-up sub-slices, not blockers.

## Context

Vox's reactive `component { … view: <markup> }` block lets authors parameterize a component's *whole* output via function parameters, but provides no first-class way to factor out a **named, typed, multiply-renderable chunk of markup** that another component receives as a prop. The current workarounds are:

1. **Children as a function prop.** Common React pattern — `(item: Item) => <Row item={item} />` — but the type system sees this as a function returning a generic `Element`, with no compile-time guarantee that the consumer actually rendered it, no validation that the right number / type of arguments are passed, and no error message that tells an LLM-generated consumer what went wrong.
2. **Sub-component per fragment shape.** Define a separate `component Row(item: Item)`. Works, but each row needs its own file, cross-file imports, and obscures the per-call-site tying-together of a list and its row renderer.
3. **Hand-written `unknown` props with runtime type assertions.** Worst case; surfaces in 100% of LLM-generated table/list code today.

Svelte 5's `{#snippet name(arg) … } / {@render name(value)}` ([snippet docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/snippet)) — covered in the [Svelte vs React Frameworks Research](../architecture/svelte-vs-react-frameworks-research-2026.md) — solves this with a typed parametric markup primitive (`Snippet<[T1, T2, …]>`). The research identified this as the single biggest reduction in plausible-but-wrong LLM-generated list/table/repeater code.

Vox needs an equivalent. Per the [grammar unification policy](../../../AGENTS.md), introducing a fragment is a candidate for a new bare-keyword scope (it opens a scope with rendering semantics distinct from `fn` / `component`), not a decorator.

## Decision

Introduce a **`fragment` bare-keyword scope** for typed parametric markup blocks. The decision splits into syntax, type system, render shape, and lowering policy.

### Syntax

```text
// vox:skip — illustrative; awaiting implementation
fragment Row(item: Item) {
  <tr><td>{item.name}</td><td>{item.price}</td></tr>
}

component Table(data: List[Item], row: Fragment[(Item,)]) {
  view: (
    <table>
      <tbody>
        for item in data {
          <RenderFragment of={row} args={(item,)} />
        }
      </tbody>
    </table>
  )
}

component Page() {
  view: (<Table data={items} row={Row} />)
}
```

Key choices baked in:

- **Keyword: `fragment`.** Alternatives considered + rejected below.
- **Body shape:** a single markup expression (same shape as `view:`); not a statement block. Future work may relax this if users need imperative setup before markup.
- **Capture rules:** fragments declared at module scope close over module-level bindings only (no implicit closure over `state`/`derived` from a containing component — that path is reserved for fragments declared *inside* a component, which is a Phase F+ extension).

### Type system

A fragment's type is `Fragment[(T1, T2, …)]` — a tuple of argument types. Empty arg list is `Fragment[()]` (callable with no arguments). The compiler:

- Validates that consumer prop signatures match fragment argument types at the call site.
- Reports `fragment.required_prop_missing` when a consumer requires a fragment prop and the caller doesn't pass one.
- Reports `fragment.arg_arity_mismatch` and `fragment.arg_type_mismatch` for misapplications.
- A fallback (`else` clause inside the consumer's `<RenderFragment>`) makes a fragment prop optional when the consumer accepts `Fragment[(…)] | None`.

### Render shape

`<RenderFragment of={fragmentValue} args={(arg1, arg2)} />`. Decision: **JSX-shaped, not decorator-shaped**.

Rationale: the JSX form is consistent with the rest of Vox markup (everything else inside `view:` is JSX-shaped). A `@render Row(item)` decorator-shaped form would introduce a new statement-vs-expression position that doesn't compose with `for` loops / `if` blocks / fragment composition. JSX-shaped composes cleanly.

Future ergonomic sugar (`{Row(item)}` shorthand) is a Phase F+ extension; the explicit `<RenderFragment>` form is the canonical lowering target.

### Lowering

In React/TSX emit:

- A `fragment Row(item: Item) { … }` declaration emits a typed React function component:
  ```ts
  // generated; illustrative
  export function Row({ item }: { item: Item }): React.ReactElement { return …; }
  ```
- A `Fragment[(Item,)]` prop type lowers to `(args: { item: Item }) => React.ReactElement`.
- `<RenderFragment of={row} args={(item,)} />` lowers to `{row({ item })}` in the consumer's TSX.
- The compiler validates required-prop / arity / type at compile time so the runtime needs no fragment-specific machinery.

Other emit targets (a future native target, etc.) can lower differently without changing the source.

### Coexistence with Phase 6 primitives

Fragments are an **authoring** primitive; Phase-6 typed semantic primitives (`stack`, `text`, `button`, `field`, …) are an **emission** primitive. A fragment body uses Phase-6 primitives in its markup; a Phase-6 primitive can accept a `Fragment[…]` prop (e.g., `<Table row={Row} />`). They compose orthogonally.

The deferral decision: do not implement fragments before the Phase 6 primitive surface stabilizes. A fragment authored today against raw JSX (`<tr><td>…</td></tr>`) would migrate twice — once to the Phase 6 primitive shape, once to whatever fragment composition reveals about primitive design. Wait until at least the 10 highest-usage primitives in [crates/vox-compiler/src/web_ir/primitives/mod.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/web_ir/primitives/mod.rs) have shipped per-primitive files before opening Phase F code work.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Use `fn` declarations returning `Element` plus a `@fragment` decorator.** Rejected: per the grammar policy, decorators *modify* declarations; a fragment is not a modified function — it has different scope rules (capture restrictions), different call ergonomics (`<RenderFragment>` vs function call), and different validation (consumer prop typing). A new bare-keyword scope is the consistent expression.

2. **Use `slot` as the keyword.** Rejected: `slot` carries existing connotations from the Web Components API (HTML `<slot>` element with its own distribution rules). A `slot` keyword would invite confusion about which semantics are in play. Svelte 5 itself moved *away* from `<slot />` to `{#snippet}` for the same clarity reason.

3. **Use `block` as the keyword.** Rejected: `block` is too generic; would collide with future "code block" / "raw block" features and is not self-describing.

4. **Use `template` as the keyword.** Rejected: `template` collides with the HTML `<template>` element semantics and with web-framework-specific connotations (Vue, Angular).

5. **Use a `@render fragment_name(args)` decorator-shaped render directive instead of `<RenderFragment>`.** Rejected: introduces a new statement-position decorator that doesn't compose inside JSX expressions, `for` loops, conditional blocks, or other fragments. The JSX-shaped `<RenderFragment>` composes cleanly everywhere and matches the rest of Vox's markup.

6. **Make fragments first-class function values without a keyword.** Rejected: erases the structural signal that this is markup-shaped, complicates compiler validation (the compiler must guess from return type whether a function is a fragment), and harms LLM codegen (the AI has no syntactic landmark to anchor on).

7. **Borrow Svelte's `{#snippet}` literal syntax verbatim.** Rejected: Vox uses neither `{#…}` block syntax nor `{@…}` directive syntax anywhere else. Adopting them just for fragments would fragment the grammar.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fixes the most common LLM-generated GUI bug class (render-prop confusion) by giving the compiler concrete typed primitives to validate against.
- Provides the expressivity to build a Vox-native equivalent of Svelte 5 snippets, which the comparative research identified as the most AI-friendly markup primitive in 2026.
- Lets authors factor a `Table` / `List` / `Repeater` consumer apart from its row/item renderer without per-row component files.
- Composes cleanly with Phase 6 primitives (orthogonal axis: authoring vs. emission).

### Negative

- New bare-keyword scope adds parser complexity (lexer token, AST node, HIR node, lowering pass).
- New diagnostic codes (`fragment.required_prop_missing`, `fragment.arg_arity_mismatch`, `fragment.arg_type_mismatch`).
- Decision to gate on Phase 6 primitives stabilizing means Phase F is on the critical path of TASK-6.1.

### Neutral

- Existing `component`/`fn` semantics unchanged — fragments are purely additive.
- React-emit target unchanged — fragments lower to typed React function components.
- No effect on the [Phase 5 React interop spec](../architecture/phase5-react-interop-spec-2026.md) — emitted fragments are first-class TS exports consumable by external React apps.

## Open questions (resolve at implementation time)

1. **Local-fragment scope inside `component { }`.** Should `fragment Row(item) { … }` declared inside a component implicitly close over the component's `state` / `derived` bindings? Phase F v1 says **no** (module-scope only); a Phase F+ extension may revisit when a real consumer surfaces.
2. **Recursive fragments.** Svelte's snippets support self-recursion (e.g., for tree rendering). Phase F v1: out of scope; revisit when a tree-rendering consumer surfaces.
3. **`<RenderFragment>` ergonomic shorthand.** A `{Row(item)}` form is more succinct but harder to grep. Phase F v1: ship the explicit `<RenderFragment>` form only; revisit shorthand after real-world use.
4. **Fragments exported from `.vox.ui` modules.** ADR-032 makes `.vox.ui` modules a thing for module-scope reactive state; whether they can also export fragments is a follow-up. Likely yes (fragments are a packaging concept; same reasoning applies), but defer the decision.

## Implementation references (deferred)

When Phase F code work starts, the touch surface is:

- New lexer token `Token::Fragment` at [crates/vox-compiler/src/lexer/token.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/lexer/token.rs) (with `Display` arm).
- New AST node `FragmentDecl` at [crates/vox-compiler/src/ast/decl/](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/ast/decl/).
- Top-level decl dispatch in [crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/mod.rs](../../../crates/vox-compiler/src/parser/descent/mod.rs) — same surface as `component` / `state_machine` (four sites: skip-recovery, async-fn, top-level fn, pub-fn).
- New HIR node `HirFragmentDecl`.
- New codegen at `crates/vox-compiler/src/codegen_ts/fragment_emit.rs`.
- Web IR validation: ensure fragments referenced in `<RenderFragment>` exist; arity / type match.
- Goldens: at minimum `examples/golden/fragment_table_row.vox` (a `<Table>` parameterized by a row fragment).
- Doctest fences in `docs/src/tutorials/` covering `<RenderFragment>` use.
