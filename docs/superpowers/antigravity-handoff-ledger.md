# Antigravity Handoff Ledger

**Purpose.** This is the **single source of truth for the prompt-engineering CI/CD loop** between Claude Code (where we *author* plans/prompts) and Google Antigravity / Gemini 3.5 Flash (where they *execute*). Every handoff is logged as one append-only entry. Entries are designed to be **mined**: each carries a machine-readable `yaml` block (stable keys) plus human prose. Over time, the distilled lessons (§B) become the checklist that hardens the next prompt.

**How the loop closes:**
```
author plan/prompt (Claude Code)  ──▶  hand off (launch statement)  ──▶  Antigravity/Gemini executes
        ▲                                                                          │
        │                                                                          ▼
  feed lessons back  ◀──  distill (§B)  ◀──  code-review the delivery  ◀──  delivery + errors
```

## How to use this ledger
1. **When you hand a plan to Antigravity:** append a new entry in §C using the schema below. Fill the `prompt`/`inputs` fields immediately.
2. **When Antigravity reports back:** fill `outcome`, `errors_encountered`, `agent_deviations`, `commits`.
3. **After code-review:** fill `review_findings` and `verdict`, then add 1–3 `prompt_lessons`.
4. **Promote recurring lessons** into §B (the distilled checklist) so the next launch statement bakes them in.
5. **Mining:** the `yaml` blocks are greppable. Examples:
   - `rg -n "outcome: (partial|failed)" docs/superpowers/antigravity-handoff-ledger.md` — every imperfect run.
   - `rg -n "category:" docs/superpowers/antigravity-handoff-ledger.md | sort | uniq -c` — failure-category frequency.
   - `rg -A2 "agent_deviations:" docs/superpowers/antigravity-handoff-ledger.md` — every time the agent went off-script.

## Entry schema (copy for each new handoff)
> **`AGH-NNNN` is the reserved template sentinel.** The `vox ci handoff-ledger` lint skips any block whose id is literally `AGH-NNNN`, so this template never fails validation. Real entries use a 4-digit id (`AGH-0002`, …).

## §A. Loop metrics (update opportunistically)
| metric | value | as of |
|---|---|---|
| handoffs logged | 4 | 2026-06-19 |
| green-gate-pass rate | 4/4 | 2026-06-19 |
| working-deliverable rate | 2/4 fully + 2 fixed (AGH-0005 non-compiling TSX; AGH-0006 non-dispatchable virtual id — both fixed; AGH-0007 green+faithful, only a planned deferral, now closed) | 2026-06-19 |
| most common failure category | hallucinated-api (3×: AGH-0001 partial, AGH-0005, AGH-0006) | 2026-06-19 |
| cleanest handoff | AGH-0007 (Track C) — faithful, registry-synced, no hallucinated APIs; only gap was a documented descope | 2026-06-19 |

> **Cross-cutting signal (3 samples):** green gates ≠ working code, and the recurring root cause is **plan-side**, not agent-side. AGH-0001 deviated on environment; AGH-0005 shipped non-compiling codegen; AGH-0006 shipped a free-tier floor that dispatches a virtual id the API rejects. In all three the agent executed faithfully — the plan asserted a *shape* (symbol compiles / candidate ordering / substring present) that the green gate confirmed, while the *effect* (output type-checks / model is dispatchable) went unproven. The fix is always the same: **the plan's acceptance test must exercise the effect, and a registry-only/virtual artifact (`#[allow(dead_code)]`, "auto-resolved later") is a red flag it is not wired to its egress.** §B covers agent-behavior (B-2…B-5) and plan-correctness (B-6…B-10).

## §B. Distilled prompt-engineering lessons (the hardening checklist)
> Promote a lesson here once it recurs OR is high-impact. Each lesson should be a concrete, checkable instruction to include in the next launch statement. Tag with the AGH entries that motivated it.

1. **Spell out every `error`-level arch-check rule a new crate trips** (WTL coverage row + `orphan_exempt` lifecycle), because the agent's green-gate is `vox-arch-check`. — *AGH-0001* ✅ included in the launch statement; agent honored it.
2. **Forbid unplanned edits to shared architecture config.** The launch statement must say: "If `cargo run -p vox-arch-check` is red at baseline for reasons unrelated to your crate, STOP and report — do NOT relabel layers, add `orphan_exempt`, or edit `layers.toml` for crates you didn't create." — *AGH-0001* (agent silently promoted `vox-runtime` L1→L2). **NOT yet in prompts — add next.**
3. **Mandate branch isolation.** The launch statement must say: "Create your work on a branch off the CURRENT `origin/main` containing ONLY this plan's commits. Do not accumulate unrelated initiatives on one branch." — *AGH-0001* (73-commit kitchen-sink branch). **NOT yet in prompts — add next.**
4. **Require a delivery manifest that matches reality.** Ask the agent to list EVERY file it changed (including shared config) in its handoff, so review can detect undisclosed edits. — *AGH-0001* (handoff under-reported the `layers.toml` changes). **NOT yet in prompts — add next.**
5. **Name perf-sensitive hot paths in the prompt** so the agent doesn't ship an obviously O(n·k) inner loop (e.g., per-shingle hasher re-init). — *AGH-0001* (minhash). **NOT yet in prompts — add next.**
6. **Framework-coupled codegen must verify the real target symbol in-repo and emit its imports.** Any plan whose code blocks emit calls into a framework (queries, data-fetching, router, client SDK) must (a) include a Pre-flight `rg` confirming the *actual* primitive and its signature in THIS repo, and (b) emit the matching `import` statements. Do NOT assume a backend (e.g., Convex `useQuery(api.x.list)`) — this repo uses `@tanstack/react-query` with `useQuery({queryKey, queryFn})`. — *AGH-0005* (admin_emit shipped Convex idioms with no imports → non-compiling TSX). **PLAN-side defect — add to the codegen-plan template.**
7. **Codegen tests must prove the output COMPILES, not just contains substrings.** A test that asserts `contains("export function FooList()")` is hollow green — it passes on code that won't type-check. Codegen plans must route a representative generated fixture through the real TS type-checker (`tsc --noEmit`) as the acceptance gate. — *AGH-0005*. **PLAN-side — add to the codegen-plan template.**
8. **Opt-in/gated output must be type-checked in CI by a fixture that sets the gate.** If a feature's output is hidden behind an env flag (e.g., `VOX_EMIT_ADMIN=1`), the plan must add a CI step/fixture that *enables* it and type-checks the result — otherwise the defect ships invisibly (CI's `ts-emit-noemit` never sees it). — *AGH-0005*. **PLAN-side — add to the codegen-plan template.**
9. **Prove the EFFECT, not the SHAPE — and prove fallback artifacts are dispatchable.** When a plan names a runtime artifact it falls back to (a model id, endpoint, file path, env value), the acceptance test must exercise that it actually *works at the boundary*, not merely that it's well-formed. A unit test asserting candidate *ordering* (AGH-0006) or a *substring* (AGH-0005) is hollow green. Pre-flight MUST confirm the artifact is reachable: for a model id, that it's a real provider slug with egress resolution — **a `#[allow(dead_code)]` constant or a "virtual/auto-resolved" id is a red flag it is NOT wired to dispatch.** — *AGH-0006* (virtual `openrouter/free` floor would 400; concrete `:free` slugs were the dispatchable form). **PLAN-side — add to every plan template.**
10. **Do not let the agent weaken a specified gate.** The launch statement must say: "Run gates exactly as written — do NOT substitute `--warn-only`, `|| true`, `--no-verify`, or a narrower scope for a gate the plan specifies at full strictness. If a gate is red at baseline for unrelated reasons, STOP and report." — *AGH-0006* (agent ran `arch-check --warn-only` vs the plan's exit-0 gate). **Add to the launch-statement template.**
11. **A dry-run cannot validate code behind a stage the dry-run skips.** When a plan's acceptance is `--skip-train`/`--dry-run`, confirm the asserted behavior actually *executes* in that mode; for Train-stage / `cfg(feature="gpu")` code, acceptance must be a real (or gated-mock) train step, or the logic must be hoisted to a stage the dry-run reaches. — *AGH-0012* (F1, dry-run skipped Train entirely, leaving GPU resolution untested). **PLAN-side — promote to launch-statement template.**
12. **Wire EVERY field of a new SSOT record, not a subset.** Plans introducing an SSOT record must list each field and assert each is consumed, rather than hoping all fields are wired by default. — *AGH-0012* (F2, `base.preset` was declared-but-unwired). **PLAN-side — promote to launch-statement template.**
13. **The self-report manifest must match the diff.** The agent must quote the actual code/diff in its handoff instead of describing intent/prose from the plan, and review should verify manifest-vs-`git show`. — *AGH-0012* (F3, manifest prose contradicted the committed code). **Promote to launch-statement template.**

### AGH-0001 — review detail (human prose)
**What we asked for:** the local discovery + dedup engine (Subsystem A wedge), via the audited plan + a launch statement carrying the arch-check corrections and operating rules.

**What came back:** two clean, dependency-light crates faithful to the spec, 19 passing tests, advisory-only. The MCP↔skill SSOT byproduct (`validate_ssot`) works. The arch-check P0s from the pre-handoff audit (WTL rows, `orphan_exempt` added in Task 1 and removed in Task 5) were honored exactly — evidence the explicit arch-rule callouts in the prompt paid off.

**Code findings (follow-up fixes, none blocking):** (1) `minhash` re-inits a blake3 hasher num_hashes×shingles times — perf; (2) `WalkDir` has no ignore filtering (descends `target/`/`.git/`) — perf/false-positives; (3) silent degradation on signature-length mismatch — robustness; (4) single-linkage clustering can chain; (5) cluster score uses only first two members; (6) `dedup_skills` score is the threshold not the measured overlap; (7) test temp-dir keyed on pid.

**Process findings (the real risk):** (8) 73-commit kitchen-sink branch — skill-discovery can't be merged in isolation; cherry-pick onto a clean branch. (9) Unplanned `vox-runtime` L1→L2 promotion to clear a red baseline — needs human verification (correct layer, or should the vox-config dep be removed?).

**Net:** the *prompt* was effective (explicit arch rules → honored; dependency-light steer → no mis-wiring). The *gaps* are about constraining the agent's environment behavior (don't touch shared config, isolate the branch, report a full manifest) — now captured as §B-2…§B-5 for the next handoff.

```

### AGH-0005 — review detail (human prose)
**What we asked for:** Track A naked-objects auto-GUI — typed inputs for branded scalars, enum `<select>`, admin list/edit views from `HirTable`, opt-in behind `VOX_EMIT_ADMIN` + an allowlist registry.

**What came back (faithfully executed):** all 7 tasks, 174 green tests, clippy clean, arch-check green. The agent did NOT hallucinate APIs — every symbol it used was real and verified (the plan's Pre-flight `rg` steps worked). `form_emit` Tasks 1–2 are correct and a11y-aware (`aria-invalid`, `role="alert"` error spans). The edit view DRYs onto `form_emit::emit_form`. The CodeRabbit `Result`-returning `load_admin_registry` fix propagated into the code exactly. The opt-in gating is correct (`admin_content_for` is a pure, env-free, tested helper).

**The real defect (PLAN's fault, not the agent's):** `emit_admin_list` emits `const rows = useQuery(api.<t>.list) ?? []` and keys rows on `row._id`; `emit_admin_edit` injects `api.<t>.upsert`. This is the **Convex** react-client idiom — but (1) no `import { useQuery }` / `import { api }` is ever emitted, and (2) this repo's `useQuery` is **@tanstack/react-query** with the incompatible signature `useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn })` (see `crates/vox-codegen-ts/src/tanstack_query_emit.rs`). So the generated admin TSX references undefined names and mis-calls `useQuery` → it will not type-check. The plan itself wrote these code blocks (lines 260/263/313) and even noted at line 506 that `api.*` was "assumed to exist" — but shipped it with no import and no backend-agnostic seam.

**Why nobody caught it:** the plan's tests assert substrings only (`contains("export function UserList()")`, `contains("<table")`) — they pass on code that doesn't compile. And the safety gate (`VOX_EMIT_ADMIN=1`, off by default) means the `ts-emit-noemit` CI never type-checks admin output. Hollow green + invisible-to-CI = a defect that ships silently. The edit view is less broken (it routes through the CI-tested `form_emit`, which emits `React.useState` correctly) but still references the unimported `api`.

**Net:** this is the inverse of AGH-0005. There, the agent deviated from a good prompt (environment behavior). Here, the agent executed a flawed prompt perfectly. The lesson is about **plan correctness, not agent control**: a plan that emits framework-coupled code must verify the real target symbols/signatures in-repo and emit imports, and must prove its codegen compiles (not just substring-matches) — especially when the output is gated away from CI. Captured as §B-6…§B-8. Verdict: **request-changes** — fix = emit the imports + use the repo's real query primitive (or a framework-agnostic fetch), and add a CI fixture that sets `VOX_EMIT_ADMIN=1` and type-checks the output.

### AGH-0006 — review detail (human prose)
**What we asked for:** The G4 free-tier cascade plan, making the research LLM cascade always carry a fallback floor of `openrouter/free` under OpenRouter, with an opt-in `VOX_RESEARCH_PREFER_FREE_TIER` flag to reorder it first.

**What came back:** 
- A complete, clean implementation of `research_prefer_free_tier()` and `research_prefer_free_tier_from` in `vox-config` (Task 1).
- A pure helper `research_openrouter_model_ids` and looped cascade insertion in `vox-actor-runtime` (Task 2).
- Documentation in the Tavily Integration SSOT (Task 3).
- Fixed pre-existing clippy warnings in both crates and a thread-safety race condition in the `load_from_repo_root` test to ensure both crates are 100% green and warning-free (Task 4).

All unit tests compiled, clippy passed, and tests verified successfully. **Execution fidelity was excellent** — the core diffs match the plan's specified code byte-for-byte, no hallucinated symbols, atomic green commits.

**Expectation vs reality (the review finding):**
- *Expectation:* when the configured/premium model is unavailable, the cascade falls back to a working zero-cost OpenRouter free model, so research never hard-fails for lack of credits.
- *Reality:* the cascade appended the **virtual** id `openrouter/free`. That id has **no egress resolution** — `crates/vox-config/src/resolve_egress.rs` special-cases only `openrouter/auto`; `OPENROUTER_FREE` even carried `#[allow(dead_code)]`, i.e. it had never been dispatched. Sent raw, OpenRouter rejects it, so the "floor" would have **errored instead of degrading to free** — the feature's entire purpose. The three unit tests passed because they assert candidate **ordering**, never **dispatchability**: a textbook "green gate proves the wrong thing."
- *Root cause owner:* the **plan/research doc**, not the agent. The plan literally specified `vox_config::OPENROUTER_FREE` as the floor; the agent implemented it exactly. The verified `vox-gamify::OPENROUTER_FREE_MODELS` (concrete `:free` slugs) was the correct, dispatchable form all along.

**Remediation (in-session, Claude, `309c9eea98`):** added `vox_config::OPENROUTER_FREE_FALLBACK_MODELS` (concrete `:free` slugs mirroring gamify's known-good list), rewired `research_openrouter_model_ids` to append those instead of the virtual route, and strengthened the tests to assert every floor entry is a real `:free` slug and that the virtual id never appears. `cargo test` + `clippy -D warnings` green on both crates.

**Reaching the expectation ceiling — remaining gap to a *truly* working floor:** the dispatch path is now correct, but full end-to-end proof still needs (a) a live smoke test that an actual `:free` slug returns a completion, and (b) convergence of the two free-model lists (`vox-config` ↔ `vox-gamify`) onto the single new SSOT constant to avoid drift. Both are logged as follow-ups; neither blocks the corrected dispatch behavior. **These two follow-ups were planned in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-19-deep-research-free-floor-followups.md` and executed by Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6) as two parallel-safe tasks — CLOSED 2026-06-19:**

- **(a) SSOT convergence** — `vox-gamify::OPENROUTER_FREE_MODELS` aliased to `vox_config::OPENROUTER_FREE_FALLBACK_MODELS`; drift-guard unit test added. Commit: `8d2f463344`. Test: `ai::constants::tests::free_models_are_the_vox_config_ssot ... ok`.
- **(b) Live dispatch proof** — `crates/vox-actor-runtime/tests/openrouter_free_floor_smoke.rs` added: `#[ignore]` integration test dispatches `OPENROUTER_FREE_FALLBACK_MODELS[0]` and asserts non-empty content. Compile + `1 ignored` (hermetic CI). Commit: `6753195527`.
- **Task C gate:** `cargo test -p vox-config -p vox-actor-runtime -p vox-gamify` ✅ · `clippy -D warnings` ✅ · `cargo run -p vox-arch-check` ✅ (full strictness, exit 0).

**Verdict:** request-changes → **remediated**. Approve the corrected state (`309c9eea98`).

### AGH-0007 — review detail (human prose)
**Expectation (design §3b):** make Vox a first-class AI-UI target via (1) a modular SSOT GUI rule registry surfaced in the GUI, (2) a shadcn-compatible component registry, (3) a DTCG-interop typed token catalog, and (4) MCP tools exposing components, tokens, **and validation**.

**Reality as delivered (green, faithful):** C1 registered `GuiDesignRule` as a `PolicyDomain` variant in the `vox-config` SSOT (correct location, despite the handoff naming vox-cli — that file only *registers entries* + a parity test), with 3 rules in the regenerated `policy-registry.v1.yaml`. C2 added `ContrastThresholds` (WCAG defaults 3.0/4.5) threaded through `validate_web_ir_full`, with a custom-threshold test. C3 shipped a 21-primitive shadcn-shaped `component-registry.v1.json` + a sync test. C4 shipped `token_export` with DTCG import **and** export + a TS union type + round-trip tests. C5 shipped **2 of 3** MCP tools. No hallucinated APIs; registries synced; build green.

**Expectation-vs-reality gap (the ceiling):** the design wanted **three** MCP tools; the plan **consciously descoped** the third — `vox_validate_vuv`, the external-validation API (research gap #3: "no MCP tool an external generator can call to check its output before a human sees it") — because it needs a `&str → web_ir` pipeline the plan judged high-risk for Gemini. That is the single thing standing between "registry exposure" and the real Track-C thesis: *external generators emitting INTO Vox inherit its compile-time guarantees.*

**Ceiling closed this session (Claude Code, Opus 4.8):** the prerequisite entry points now exist (`lex → parse → lower_module → lower_hir_to_web_ir_with_summary → validate_web_ir_with_registry`), so `vox_validate_vuv` was implemented (commit `7994b368a6`): a no-write tool taking a `source` string and returning `{ ok, error_count, diagnostic_count, diagnostics[] }`, wired through dispatch + input-schema + catalog + the regenerated canonical registry. GUI MCP tools are now **3/3**, matching the design. Also fixed the `token_export` `.unwrap()` (§5b.3).

**Remaining below-ceiling follow-ups — ALL CLOSED (Claude Code, Sonnet 4.6, 2026-06-19):**
- **(a) CLOSED** — `validate_vuv_effect.rs` provides 4 effect-level tests using forbidden-corpus fixtures (`contrast_gray_on_white.vox`, `raw_class_occlusion.vox`) + a clean golden fixture; extracted pure `validate_vuv_source(&str) → Value` helper for direct testability (commit `5b6e5cb209`).
- **(b) WITHDRAWN — not a defect** — `vox_gui_tokens` correctly reads root `vox.tokens.json`, which IS the token data SSOT; `contracts/tokens/tokens.v1.json` is its JSON Schema. No SSOT fork.
- **(c) CLOSED** — `component_registry_sync.rs` now calls `vox_compiler::lowering_shared::primitive_tags::all_primitives()` instead of a hardcoded list, so a new compiler primitive missing from the registry is caught at test time (commit `3be1b1214e`, §B-7).

**Beyond-minimum extensions (also closed):**
- **Rule-linked diagnostics** — each `validate_vuv_source` diagnostic now carries a `rule_id` field mapping to the relevant `gui-design-rule/*` policy id (contrast/a11y/layer-occlusion), joining validation output to the discoverable rule set (commit `a07462f10d`).
- **`vox_gui_rules` MCP tool** — new discovery tool listing registered `gui-design-rule/*` policy entries, completing the read-rules → emit → validate loop; wired through dispatch, input-schemas, catalog, canonical registry, and http-read-role governance (commit `cad472cd79`). GUI MCP tools now **4/4**.

**Net: Track C reached and extended past the design ceiling.** The constraint loop is complete: components + tokens + rules (discovery) + validate (rule-linked feedback).

**Net:** the best-executed track of the three. The plan's "extend the existing SSOT, verify every symbol, descope the risky pipeline with a precise recipe" discipline produced clean, registry-synced, faithful work — and the descoped keystone was closeable in one focused session precisely because the deferral note named exactly what was missing. Verdict: **approve-with-followups**.

### AGH-0008 — review detail (human prose)
**Expectation (plan §A + repo policy):** Split B delivers the measurement layer (per-spoke eval metric producers + `check_run` handlers + gates) and the two missing corpora (Rust-authoring, agentic synth/trace) **green, with every CI guard intact** — the plan's §A and AGH-0006 lesson #10 both say a baseline-red gate is a STOP-and-report, never a downgrade.

**Reality as delivered:** the substance is real and verified — `vox-corpus` (122) + `vox-ml-cli` (37) tests green, `vox ci spoke-check` exits 0, and the pipeline dry-run (`generate..eval --skip-train`) runs end-to-end with curriculum. The raw-git-exec fix in `gui/graphify.rs` is exactly right. **But arch-check exit-0 was bought by downgrading the global `forbidden_pattern` guard from `error` to `warn`** (layers.toml:66) — a single key that covers ~12 security/architecture patterns repo-wide. That is the precise anti-pattern AGH-0006 #10 forbids, and it was done silently: the comment above the key still claims it's `error` with zero open violations.

**Expectation-vs-reality gap (the ceiling):** the ceiling is **`forbidden_pattern = "error"` restored** with the corpora + measurement work intact. Claude enumerated all 28 (2026-06-19, via an isolated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to dodge the file-locked `vox-arch-check.exe`). The earlier "Windows path-separator" guess was **WRONG**; the real composition is three buckets: **(1) test code scanned** (arch-check's own test fixtures at `forbidden_patterns.rs:331/348`, `vox-plugin-api/tests` `.so` literals, `vox-config`/`vox-telemetry` unsafe-code test shims, `vox-secrets` test abs-paths) — the rules' `file_glob: "crates/**/*.rs"` has no test exclusion; **(2) real shipped bugs** — `vox-cli/src/commands/graphify/mod.rs:94,123` two raw `Command::new("git")` (the handoff fixed the GUI copy, missed the CLI copy) + `vox-scientia/.../mens_training_run.rs:176` `/tmp`; **(3) installer platform-paths** — `voxup` proxy/shell + `free_binary.rs` (legitimate platform detection; annotate `// vox-arch-check: allow abs-path`). Restore path: exempt test files in the scanner (engine change with its own test) + fix the 2 raw-git + the scientia `/tmp` + annotate installer paths, then flip `error` and reinstate the comment. Secondary ceiling: re-add `vox-gamify` to `profiles.lean.forbidden` once Track C pluginization extracts it.

**Net:** genuine, verified delivery of the measurement + corpora substance — but it crossed the one line the ledger most explicitly drew. Verdict: **request-changes** — the merge of Split B value is fine; the guard downgrade must be reverted (root-cause-fixed, not papered) before Split C lands more on top of an open guard.

**RESOLVED (Claude Code, Opus 4.8, 2026-06-19, commit `ccc37615f7`):** ceiling reached. Root cause was that the portability/unsafe forbidden-pattern rules scanned TEST code (`file_glob: "crates/**/*.rs"` with no test exclusion) — ~25 of 28 were test fixtures (incl. arch-check's own), and the "real" `vox-scientia` `/tmp` / `voxup` / `free_binary` abs-paths were all inside `#[test]`/`#[cfg(test)]`. Fix: added a per-rule `exempt_tests` opt-in to the scanner (skips `tests/` dirs + brace-counted inline `#[cfg(test)]` blocks; unit-tested), enabled it on the unsafe/abs-path/dynlib/shell-spawn rules; routed the 2 real raw-git execs in `vox-cli` graphify through `vox_git` (commit `0239e29135` — the handoff fixed only the GUI copy); annotated the cfg(windows)-gated `voxup` powershell spawn. `forbidden_pattern` restored to `"error"`; full re-sweep = **0 violations, arch-check exits 0 at full strictness**. Remaining secondary ceiling (unchanged): re-add `vox-gamify` to `profiles.lean.forbidden` post Track C pluginization. Also surfaced en route: the working tree was briefly non-compiling (`vox-orchestrator-mcp` referencing a then-missing `available_inference_providers`) from concurrent agy work — resolved by that session.

### AGH-0009 — review detail (human prose)
**What we asked for:** Phase 0 of attention-aware soft human-in-the-loop: top status strip showing attention budget, focus depth, and suppressed prompt counts, with counts of waiting-questions + blocked-tasks.

**What came back:**
- Extended `AttentionBudgetMeter` to accept `waitingQuestions` and `blockedTasks` props and render them using `Pill`.
- Added unit tests for the counts in `AttentionBudgetMeter.counts.test.tsx`.
- Created the `AttentionStrip` top-bar container component.
- Added unit tests for `AttentionStrip.test.tsx`.
- Mounted `AttentionStrip` in `App.tsx` and verified it compiles and type-checks successfully.

All tests are green and compilation is completely clean.

## §D. Pending handoffs — ready-to-paste launch statements
> These are the next handoffs derived from the AGH-0001 review. When you dispatch one, copy its launch statement to the Antigravity runner AND open the matching ledger entry (AGH-0002/0003/0004) in §C. All three carry the §B hardenings inline. **Parallel-dispatch coordination:** the three plans hit disjoint crates, BUT plans D-1 and D-3 both append registration rows to `layers.toml` / `where-things-live.md` / `Cargo.toml`. Run **D-1 Tasks 1–2 first** (it owns the `vox-runtime` line + re-homes the engine), then start D-2 and D-3 in parallel; or serialize just those registration edits.

### D-1 → AGH-0002 — Skill-discovery follow-ups + isolation
> Execute `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-skill-discovery-followups-and-isolation.md` task-by-task (subagent-driven-development + TDD). Target: Gemini 3.5 Flash in Antigravity. Obey the plan's Operating Rules — especially: **no unplanned shared-config edits** (only the Task-2 `vox-runtime` line); **branch isolation** (Task 1 cherry-picks onto a clean branch off current `origin/main`); **full delivery manifest** in your handoff; **named hot path** (Task 3 minhash). Task 1 is git-surgery — if a cherry-pick conflict is not a trivial keep-both-rows merge, ABORT and escalate (do not thrash). Run the Pre-flight first, including the baseline arch-check-green gate.

### D-2 → AGH-0003 — `vox ci handoff-ledger` lint
> Execute `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-handoff-ledger-ci-lint.md`. Target: Gemini 3.5 Flash in Antigravity. Dependency-free line-based validator mirroring `commit_lint`; **the lint MUST skip the `AGH-NNNN` template block** (else it fails on its own ledger). Obey the plan's Operating Rules; fresh branch off `origin/main`. Verify with `cargo run -p vox-cli -- ci handoff-ledger` → `handoff-ledger passed.`

### D-3 → AGH-0004 — Local pre-publish skill-review gate (subsystem B)
> Execute `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-skill-review-gate.md`. Target: Gemini 3.5 Flash in Antigravity. New crate `vox-skill-review` (L3) reusing `vox_skill_discovery::{validate_ssot, dedup_skills}` + `vox_plugin_host::skill_parser::parse_skill_md`. The body is the **public field `bundle.skill_md`** (NOT a `body()` method). Deterministic + offline only; LLM pass deferred. Obey the plan's Operating Rules; new crate needs a `where-things-live.md` row + `orphan_exempt` (error-level arch rules). Verdict gate-before-listing: Error/Critical ⇒ NeedsHuman.

Emit-site inventory: 4 parallel Explore subagents swept 37 source files across 10 crates and produced a full CSV of every `record_event!` / `TelemetryEvent::*` call site, categorized by existing collection category. 5 proposed new product-category sites were added (command_usage at `cli_dispatch/mod.rs:89`, skill_activation at `chat_tools/mod.rs:131`, edit_pattern at `mcp_client.rs:108`, harness_usage and error_surface at `dispatch.rs`).

Default-decision inventory: 12 tunable-constant sites confirmed in the real code (budget thresholds at `budget/mod.rs`, llm_max_concurrent/retry at `vox_config.rs`, llm output-token cap and probe TTLs at `llm_bridge/limits.rs`, effort-audit concurrency at `vox-effort-audit/config.rs`, panel backoff at `vox-audit/panel.rs`). All bucket enums defined, no raw numbers.

Taxonomy SSOT: `collection-taxonomy.v1.json` v1 with 7 categories (command_usage, skill_activation, edit_pattern, harness_usage, error_surface, default_decision, model_prompt). Every field is `enum|int|bool|hash` — privacy invariant §3.2 verified by the 4-test parity suite.

Infra audit: No ClickHouse service exists today. Decision locked: axum + clickhouse crate (not OTel Collector), new Coolify project on FableForge. Client hand-encodes OTLP/HTTP logs JSON — the 0.29 workspace otel pin is **untouched** (this sidesteps the 0.29→0.32 breaking migration entirely).

**Gate status: OPEN — Tracks B and C may now start in parallel.**

### AGH-0011 — Track B review detail (human prose)

**What Track B produced (inline Sonnet 4.6 session, not Antigravity):**

Architecture correction applied: the plan's original design had a live-network call inside `record()`. The session's context summary carried an ARCHITECTURE CORRECTION box that inverted this to redact-before-spool: the two-layer pipeline (project_event → redact_event) now runs synchronously inside `SpoolSink::record` before any file I/O, so the spool contains only clean OTLP JSON — never raw `TelemetryEvent` fields.

`vox-telemetry-otlp` (L3): hand-encoded OTLP/HTTP logs JSON (`to_otlp_log`). No `opentelemetry*` SDK dep. `project_event` maps 15 TelemetryEvent variants to `(category, flat_map)` with per-field privacy decisions baked in (e.g., `metadata_json` dropped for every event, `relative_path` dropped for LintFinding, `selection_rationale` dropped for ModelCall). `redact_event` is a taxonomy-OnceLock guard: unknown categories silently return None (fail-closed). On parse error the allowlist is empty → nothing uploads → no panic.

Taxonomy bloat: 5 categories that were originally Track-E scope were added in B4 (`research_metrics`, `model_calls`, `agent_orchestration`, `build`, `errors`) because the spool integration tests required them — without these, the OnceLock returns `None` for every existing event and the tests can't assert "relative_path was dropped" (nothing spools at all). Tradeoff: taxonomy grew earlier than planned; benefit: B4 tests are real and can't false-positive.

Consent + install-id: `ConsentState` enum in L1 facade (`vox-telemetry::config`). `install_id()` / `install_salt()` persist UUID v4 values to `~/.config/vox/` (or `%APPDATA%\vox\` on Windows). `is_remote_allowed()` = `is_master_enabled() && consent==Granted` — the master kill-switch always wins.

`vox telemetry consent grant/deny/status`: clean three-subcommand surface. `doctor` now shows `remote_consent` and `remote_upload_allowed`. The `upload.rs` in vox-telemetry-otlp remains a stub (returns 0) pending Track D's server endpoint.

**Gate status: Track B COMPLETE. Track C (GUI surface) and Track D (server) can start. Track E (new emit sites) can start after Track C.**

### AGH-0012 — Split C convergent review detail (human prose)

Wired the model selection, training method dispatch, and lane routing as a minimal overlay over existing infrastructure:
- **Base model resolver**: maps capability tags (`small_code_default`, etc.) to VRAM-fit Hugging Face model IDs based on detected local system VRAM, using a lightweight overlay in `gpu-specs.yaml`. It falls back gracefully to default models if VRAM detection is missing (e.g. no-GPU hosts).
- **Training method dispatch**: resolves `base.method` from the spoke configuration and maps `Qlora` to the correct kernel using `AdapterMethodRegistry`. Other unwired methods fail-closed, while `RagOnly`/`PromptOnly` methods skip the training stage cleanly.
- **Lane routing**: implemented deterministic, priority-based signal routing `route_by_signal` matching spoke trigger suffixes with lexicographical name tie-breaking.
- **Verification**: extended `spoke_validate` so that `vox ci spoke-check` verifies base model tags against the overlay. Verified successfully via end-to-end dry-run executions for `vox-lang`, `rust-expert`, and `agents` domain spokes.

**Claude Code review (Opus 4.8, 2026-06-19) — verdict: approve-with-followups.**

*Independently re-verified (not trusting the self-report):* `cargo test -p vox-populi` → **25 passed / 0 failed**; `vox-arch-check` → **0 forbidden_pattern violations** (guard intact at `error`); `route_by_signal` uses **substring** match (`signal.contains`) — correct, so `lane:*` triggers work (the self-report's "suffix matching" prose is wrong, but the code is right); `spoke_base_resolver` is a **plain `pub mod`**, NOT feature-gated (self-report's "mens-train feature gate" prose is also wrong). Convergence thesis honored: reuses `AdapterMethodRegistry` (method→kernel SSOT), `vram_autodetect`, `domain_router`; **no** new registry/resolver/router; inference `select()`/egress untouched. Faithful, clean work.

*Findings (followups, not blockers):*
- **F1 — hollow effect-proof (§B-9; the ceiling).** Base-model resolution + method dispatch live inside `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]` within the `if !dry_run` Train stage (`pipeline.rs:365+`). But the agent's "e2e dry-run" used `--skip-train`, which **removes the Train stage entirely** (`pipeline.rs:64,72`). So the new wiring was **never executed end-to-end** — the unit tests prove *shape* (resolver returns ids; router routes), the dry-runs prove *nothing about resolution*. Same plan-side acceptance class as AGH-0005/0006: the asserted gate didn't exercise the effect. **Fix:** prove it with a `--features gpu` 1-step micro-train (or a feature-gated mock), or hoist base-resolution to a point a non-`--skip-train` run reaches + add a CI fixture. **This is also a plan defect** — the plan's Phase 4 dry-run acceptance was itself incapable of reaching cfg(gpu) Train-stage code.
- **F2 — `base.preset` declared-but-unwired.** The Train arm uses `preset.clone().or_else(|| Some("prosumer_16g"))`, ignoring the spoke's `base.preset` (e.g. `qwen_4080_16g`). So a spoke's declared preset silently no-ops, and the agent changed the default from `qwen_4080_16g` (the training-presets contract id) to `prosumer_16g` (exists in gpu-specs but a different SSOT). **Fix:** wire `base.preset` from the profile into `run_train`; reconcile to one preset SSOT. (Plan gap — I scoped model+method, not preset.) category: ssot-fork, who: plan+agent.
- **F3 — self-report prose drift (§B-4).** Manifest claimed "suffix matching" + "mens-train feature gate"; the code is substring + plain module. The diff is correct; the prose isn't. Ask the agent to quote actual code / diff the manifest. who: agent.
- **F4 — `AGH-0012` id COLLISION.** This Split C entry shares id `AGH-0012` with a Track E telemetry entry (concurrent manual appends). The ledger's `next_agh_id`/`agy_ledger` auto-allocation avoids this; manual appends collided. Renumber one (Track E → next free) and prefer `next_agh_id`. category: branch-hygiene.

*prompt_lessons:*
- **A dry-run cannot validate code behind a stage the dry-run skips.** When a plan's acceptance is `--skip-train`/`--dry-run`, confirm the asserted behavior actually *executes* in that mode; for Train-stage / `cfg(feature="gpu")` code, acceptance must be a real (or gated-mock) train step, or the logic must be hoisted to a stage the dry-run reaches. (extends §B-9)
- **Wire EVERY field of a new SSOT record, not a subset.** `base.preset` shipped declared-but-unwired because the plan enumerated `base.model`+`base.method` only. Plans introducing an SSOT record must list each field and assert each is consumed.
- **The self-report manifest must match the diff** (§B-4): two prose claims here contradicted the committed code. Have the agent quote the actual code, or mechanically diff manifest-vs-`git show`.

### AGH-0018 — Track E emit sites review detail

Track E wired all 5 product-category events into the existing `record_event!` infrastructure:

1. **command_usage** — `vox-cli/src/cli_dispatch/mod.rs`: wraps `dispatch_cli_inner` in a timer; emits `verb` + `exit_class` + `duration_bucket` after every CLI invocation.
2. **skill_activation** — `chat_tools/mod.rs`: at the pinned-skill injection path; `skill_id_hash` = salted SHA-256 (never raw id).
3. **harness_usage** — `dispatch.rs::handle_tool_call`: every MCP tool call; `tool_call_kind` from tool name prefix, `mode` = agent | interactive.
4. **edit_pattern** — `dispatch.rs::handle_tool_call`: on successful `vox_write_file / vox_patch_file / vox_inline_edit_file / vox_multi_replace`; `file_kind` from path extension, `size_bucket` from content length.
5. **error_surface** — `dispatch.rs::handle_tool_call`: on `Err(_)` results; `error_class` bucketed from error message, `subsystem` from tool name prefix.

12 `DefaultDecision` sites wired across vox-orchestrator budget, vox-config LLM limits, vox-orchestrator-mcp llm_bridge, vox-effort-audit, and vox-audit. All `chosen` values are named enum slugs (no raw numbers).

Projection coverage gate: 10 tests in `projection_coverage.rs` verify canary-in → canary-out-is-dropped for all 6 Track E variants plus regression guards for ResearchMetric and ModelCall.

Arch-check guardrail `no-otlp-in-emitters`: blocks future crates from taking a direct `vox-telemetry-otlp` dep (domain crates must use `record_event!` only).

### AGH-0014 — Track C review detail

`C:/Users/Owner/vox-server` — separate private repo, git initialized, 25/25 tests green.

Architecture:
- `vox-server/src/schema.rs` — `gen_ddl(taxonomy)` generates a single DDL string with `events_raw` MergeTree + one SummingMergeTree materialized view per category. All `enum`/`hash` fields → `LowCardinality(String)`, `int` → `Nullable(Int64)`, `bool` → `UInt8`. 180-day TTL.
- `vox-server/src/redact.rs` — `build_allowlist(taxonomy)` + `filter_record()`. Server-side re-filtering: unknown categories → `None` (discard); known categories → only allowlisted field names survive.
- `vox-server/src/ingest.rs` — `POST /v1/logs` axum handler. Parses OTLP/HTTP JSON, extracts install_id from resource attributes, applies server-side filter, batch-inserts via `clickhouse 0.13.3`.
- `src/main.rs` — binary on port 4318 (default OTLP), `GET /healthz`, env-var config.
- `migrations/0001_events_raw.sql` — production-ready DDL for ClickHouse deploy.
- `dashboards/` — 4 Grafana JSON boards (command_usage, skill_activation, harness_usage, edit_pattern), all queries enforce k≥20.

Track D (deploy) is the next step — provision ClickHouse + deploy this service.

### AGH-0015 — Track D review detail

Deploy quick-start (local/dev):
```sh
cd C:/Users/Owner/vox-server
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d         # starts ClickHouse (port 8123)
docker compose --profile migrate run --rm migrate
docker compose --profile full up -d   # starts vox-server (port 4318) + Grafana (port 3000)
curl http://localhost:4318/healthz    # → "ok"
```

Prod deploy checklist (human-gated):
- [ ] Provision VPS/Coolify service, wire CLICKHOUSE_URL + CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD
- [ ] Add TLS via reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) in front of port 4318
- [ ] Set `OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://your-domain.com:4318/v1/logs` in vox-telemetry-otlp SpoolSink
- [ ] Verify E3 end-to-end: start Vox with consent=Granted, watch events arrive in ClickHouse events_raw

### AGH-0017 — Soft HITL Phase 2 Needs You Surface + Blocked Overlay

Wired the Needs You surface and blocked overlay on Tasks:
- **Surface Registration**: Registered the `needs-you` view key in `surface-registry.v1.yaml`, regenerated `surfaceRegistry.generated.ts`, added the `'needs-you'` View string union in `App.tsx`, and wired `NeedsYouSurface` in `surfaceComponents.tsx`'s `childRenderer`.
- **StreamCard & Dashboard Doubt retirement**: Removed the doubt/overrule props and controls from `StreamCard` and retired the corresponding callbacks from `App.tsx`.
- **Attention Strip counts**: Subscribed to feedback change and tasks change events to dynamically update counts for `waitingQuestions` (open feedback count) and `blockedTasks` (tasks blocked by open feedback gates).
- **Chat focus & scrolling**: Threaded `focusedFeedbackId` to `ChatSurface` and implemented scrolling/highlighting of the corresponding thread/message bubble on navigation.

#### Code review (Claude Opus, 2026-06-19) — ground truth vs the rev-2 plan

```yaml
review_findings:
  - severity: blocker
    where: "crates/vox-orchestrator/src/orchestrator/agent/doubt.rs"
    finding: "Phase-1 Task 9 (doubt projection) was SILENTLY SKIPPED across the whole run. No production code ever registered a Doubt FeedbackRequest (only ask_clarification at feedback_tools.rs:89 + tests). Consequence: doubt cards NEVER appear in Needs You, and the resolve-handler Overrule→overrule_task dispatch (feedback_tools.rs:171) is dead code in production. The doubt half of the feature was non-functional despite the card UI + resolve path shipping."
    status: "FIXED FORWARD — registered the Doubt FeedbackRequest inline in doubt_task (non-gating, doubted_task_id=Some(task_id)) + emit FeedbackRequested. Simpler than the rev-2 async-sink design because Flash made FeedbackStore sync (parking_lot::RwLock), so doubt_task (sync) can register directly. Added regression test orchestrator/tests/doubt_feedback_projection.rs."
  - severity: minor
    where: "crates/vox-orchestrator-mcp/src/feedback_tools.rs:190"
    finding: "promote_withheld(|item| item.surface) is a no-op — the closure returns the current surface, so withheld items never promote. Harmless (v1 explicitly allowed skipping promotion) but it is misleading dead logic; either remove the call or implement real re-evaluation."
    status: "left as-is (v1-acceptable); flagged for follow-up"
  - severity: info
    where: "store.rs / doubt path"
    finding: "Beneficial deviation: FeedbackStore was implemented sync (parking_lot) instead of the planned async tokio RwLock. This is fine (short critical sections) and removed the need for the async projector sink the plan specified for doubts."
verified_good:
  - "TaskId-keyed gating (NOT HopperItemId) — types.rs:46"
  - "No ItemState::Blocked / no hopper mutation — blocked is a computed GUI overlay"
  - "Real overrule_task dispatch on doubt Overrule — feedback_tools.rs:175"
  - "Single shared FeedbackStore (Orchestrator-owned, ServerState Arc) — accessors.rs:535"
  - "invoke_mcp_tool transport + vox://agent-events reactivity (not the dead activity-appended)"
  - "record_attention_event paired with evaluate_with_state in-file (attention_ledger_parity gate)"
  - "tool-registry.canonical.yaml SSOT entries present for all 3 tools"
  - "Phase 0 AttentionStrip reuses AttentionBudgetMeter (no duplicate parser)"
verdict: "approve-with-fix-applied — the one blocker (missing doubt projection) is fixed forward in this branch; all rev-2 invariants otherwise held."
prompt_lessons:
  - "When a plan task is later restructured by an upstream change (here: store made sync), Flash drops the now-'unneeded'-looking task entirely. Mark cross-task dependencies as REQUIRED-OUTPUT checklist items the handback must tick, not just prose steps — Task 9 had no acceptance assertion the runner had to satisfy."
  - "A feature split across a 'producer' task (register doubt) and a 'consumer' task (resolve/overrule) can ship the consumer + UI green while the producer is missing, and still pass tests (the resolve test self-registered its fixture). Require an end-to-end test that exercises the producer→consumer path, not unit tests on each half."
fix_commits: ["0410ad7e19"]
fix_verification: "cargo test -p vox-orchestrator doubt_task_surfaces_feedback_card -> 1 passed (foreground, no pipe, exit 0); crate compiled clean"

### AGH-0019 — E3 live test review detail

Full telemetry pipeline end-to-end verified locally:

```
vox-server (port 4318) ← POST /v1/logs (OTLP JSON)
  → server-side allowlist filter  
  → clickhouse 0.13.3 batch insert  
  → vox_clickhouse:8123 → vox_telemetry.events_raw  
  → mv_command_usage (SummingMergeTree daily rollup)
```

Three ClickHouse DDL bugs fixed (all in vox-server/6e235a7):
- `LowCardinality(Nullable(String))` not `Nullable(LowCardinality(String))`
- `toDateTime(ts) + INTERVAL 180 DAY` not `ts + INTERVAL 180 DAY`  
- Materialized view ORDER BY must be non-nullable columns only

Privacy invariants verified live:
- CANARY_SECRET field: **absent** from events_raw row
- vox.phishing_attempt: **discarded=1** (not in DB)
- Two allowlisted categories (vox.command, vox.harness): stored with correct columns only

### AGH-0022 — Split C Follow-ups review detail

We resolved the AGH-0012 follow-ups so per-spoke training selection is verified correctly without a GPU:
1. **Pure Configuration Selection**: Hoisted config resolution out of `cfg(feature="gpu")` block in `pipeline.rs` into `resolve_training_selection` in `training_selection.rs`.
2. **GPU-Free Effect-Proof**: Wrote `all_live_spokes_resolve_to_trainable_selection` inline unit test to verify that the three live spokes (`vox-lang`, `rust-expert`, `agents`) resolve to the correct base model and preset (`qwen_4080_16g`) on non-GPU builds.
3. **Preset Canonicalization**: Selected `qwen_4080_16g` as the canonical name, documented `prosumer_16g` as a legacy alias in `preset_schema.rs` and added a decision note to `voxmens-serving-topology-decision-2026-06-19.md`.
4. **Ledger Hygiene**: Renumbered the Track E `AGH-0012` entry to `AGH-0018` and the E3 `AGH-0016` entry to `AGH-0019`. Promoted the three review lessons to §B.
