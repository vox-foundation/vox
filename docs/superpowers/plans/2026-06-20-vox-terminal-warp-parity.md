# Vox Terminal (Warp-parity) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship a standalone, headless-capable Vox terminal+agent application (`vox-term`, ratatui) and an embeddable shared engine (`vox-terminal-core`) that brings ~95% of Warp.dev's experience onto the Vox harness, with the existing GUI Console refactored to render the *same* engine.

**Architecture:** Extract a UI-agnostic `vox-terminal-core` crate that owns the block model, input router, PTY/shell host, OSC-633 block parser, Vox-interpreter adapter, a thin adapter over `vox-orchestrator` (agent loop / HITL / hopper / budget / model-select), and a typed transcript-event stream. Front-ends (`vox-term` ratatui TUI; the existing React/Tauri Console) are thin renderers over it. A curation/redaction layer turns transcripts into a VoxMENS-ready corpus.

**Tech Stack:** Rust, `ratatui` + `crossterm` (TUI), `portable-pty` (PTY/ConPTY — already in use), **`alacritty_terminal`** (VT-grid emulation for headless rendering — Apache/MIT), clean-room OSC-633 parser, `nucleo` (command palette), `reedline` (line editing), `tokio`, `vox-orchestrator` (agent, feature-gated), `vox-journal` (transcript substrate), `vox-telemetry-otlp` redaction, `vox-similarity` (dedup), `vox-compiler` `eval --interp` (Vox-native, feature-gated). Default font: **IBM Plex Mono Nerd Font**.

## 0. How to read this plan

This spans multiple subsystems, so it is structured as a **master plan with sequenced Tracks**. Each Track produces working, testable software on its own.

- **Track 1 (`vox-terminal-core` foundation)** is the critical path and is written out in **full bite-sized TDD steps** — every other Track depends on its public types.
- **Tracks 2–7** are decomposed to **file map + interface + task list** granularity. They depend on types Track 1 creates, so their step-level TDD is intentionally deferred to the **Phase-4 audit/rewrite** (per the project's research→plan→audit→handoff process). Do **not** start a Track 2–7 task before Track 1's interfaces are merged and frozen.
- §4 (Claude Code execution strategy) tells the implementing harness *how* to parallelize and where the harness's own limits bite.

---

## 1. Codebase audit — retire / move / keep

Grounded in the current tree (read, not guessed):

| Existing asset | Path | Disposition | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| PTY host + OSC-633 shell-integration snippets (pwsh/bash) | `crates/vox-gui/src/commands/pty.rs` | **MOVE → `vox-terminal-core::pty` (de-Tauri-fy)** | Pure logic (`default_shell`, `shell_integration_snippet`, `PtyManager`) is reusable; only the `#[tauri::command]` wrappers + `Emitter` are GUI-specific. Replace event emission with an `mpsc` byte stream. Leave a thin Tauri shim in vox-gui that calls core. |
| OSC-633 block parser | `crates/vox-gui/ui/src/components/surfaces/Console/osc633.ts` | **REWRITE in Rust → `vox-terminal-core::osc633`** | Block assembly currently only exists in TS, so the TUI can't get blocks. Port the state machine to Rust (it's our code — no license concern). Keep `osc633.ts` until Track 3 retires it. |
| Live EventBus dashboard | `crates/vox-cli/src/commands/live.rs` | **KEEP as reference; later re-skin over core** | Already subscribes to `orch.event_bus()` and renders an ANSI dashboard — the canonical pattern for the TUI's event rendering. Not the agent loop. |
| Vox-expression REPL | `crates/vox-cli/src/commands/repl.rs` | **MOVE logic → `vox-terminal-core::vox_interp`** | The interpreter wiring (`run_frontend_str_with_options` + `Interpreter`) is exactly the Vox-native execution path. `vox repl` becomes a thin alias. |
| Agent-definition CRUD | `crates/vox-cli/src/commands/agent.rs` | **KEEP unchanged** | Not a loop — just registry CRUD. Out of scope. |
| React Console surfaces | `crates/vox-gui/ui/.../surfaces/Console/*` | **REFACTOR → thin renderer over core (Track 3)** | `Console.tsx`, `TerminalTab.tsx`, `AgentStrip.tsx`, `DiscoveryRail.tsx` keep their look; their block/agent logic delegates to new Tauri commands backed by core. |
| Orchestrator engine | `crates/vox-orchestrator/*` | **KEEP; ADAPT (never reimplement)** | `feedback`, `hopper`, `budget`, `attention`, `events`, `build_repo_scoped_orchestrator`, `event_bus()` are consumed through a thin `vox-terminal-core::agent` adapter. |
| Transcript substrate | `crates/vox-journal` | **KEEP; consume** | Append-only crash-safe JSONL is the flywheel's source of truth. |
| Redaction/projection | `crates/vox-telemetry-otlp` (`redact_event`, `project_event`) | **KEEP; reuse in flywheel** | Secret-stripping for the training corpus. |
| Near-dup similarity | `crates/vox-similarity` | **KEEP; reuse in flywheel** | Corpus dedup. |
| History/clip store, context_windows domain | `crates/vox-db` | **KEEP; consume** | Persistence for blocks/history. |

**Net new crates:** `vox-terminal-core` (lib, **L3** — same layer as `vox-orchestrator`/`vox-compiler`; same-layer deps are allowed) and `vox-term` (**bin, L5** — layers.toml has no L4; all binaries are L5, e.g. `vox-cli`/`vox-gui`/`vox-orchestrator-d`).

**Lean-core feature gating (audit-driven):** `vox-compiler` is ~47k LoC (pulls reqwest/rayon/compression) and `vox-orchestrator` is ~70k LoC. To keep a minimal headless/server build cheap, `vox-terminal-core`'s **default features are minimal** (`block`, `input`, `pty`, `osc633`, `transcript`); the Vox interpreter is behind feature **`vox-lang`** (adds `vox-compiler`), the agent adapter behind feature **`agent`** (adds `vox-orchestrator`), and Nushell behind **`nushell`**. `vox-term` enables all three; a server embedder can take just blocks+PTY.

### Architecture decision: VT emulation lives in the *front-end*, not the core (audit finding #1)

The GUI delegates **all** ANSI/cursor/color interpretation to **xterm.js** (`TerminalTab.tsx:89 term.write(data)`). A headless ratatui front-end has no such engine, so raw PTY bytes would render as literal escape codes and full-screen apps (vim/htop) would break. Decision:

- **`vox-terminal-core` stays VT-agnostic.** It captures **raw output bytes** per block (correct for transcript/agent context) and exposes `plain_output()` that **strips ANSI** via a small built-in CSI/OSC escape stripper (see Task 1.2 `strip_ansi` — no extra dep; used only for the text projection, not rendering).
- **Each front-end owns its renderer.** GUI keeps xterm.js. **`vox-term` (Track 2) owns an `alacritty_terminal` grid** that consumes the raw byte stream and produces a cell grid ratatui paints. This is the same Alacritty model Warp forked — taken **upstream** (Apache/MIT), license-clean.
- **OSC-633 block boundaries and VT rendering are orthogonal layers:** the core's `osc633` parser delimits blocks; the front-end's VT grid renders the bytes *within* a block. Neither replaces the other.

---

## 2. Where (and whether) to draw from Warp.dev source

Warp open-sourced in **April 2026** ([github.com/warpdotdev/warp](https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp)) under a **split license**: `warpui_core` + `warpui` are **MIT**; **everything else — terminal, Agent Mode, blocks, persistence, LSP, settings, CLI — is AGPLv3.**

**Rule: clean-room reuse of *patterns*, not *code*.** The parts we'd want (block engine, Agent Mode, shell integration, persistence) are AGPLv3; AGPL's network-copyleft would force all linking Vox code to AGPL and to publish source to network users — incompatible with Vox's licensing/plugin/commercial posture. **No AGPL Warp source enters the tree.** We read those crates as an *architecture reference* and reimplement.

| Warp area | Draw type | What we take | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block model (`terminal`/blocks) | **Reference only** | The *idea*: command+output+exit+timing as selectable data | `vox-terminal-core::block` (clean-room) |
| Agent Mode context threading | **Reference only** | How blocks feed agent context; turn boundaries | `vox-terminal-core::agent` (over our orchestrator) |
| Shell integration | **None needed** | We already have our own OSC-633 (`pty.rs`) | already ours |
| `warpui` GPU framework (MIT) | **Vendorable IF needed** | Only relevant if we later add a GPU renderer — **out of scope** (we chose ratatui) | n/a for this plan |
| Alacritty grid/state model | **Use upstream directly** (`alacritty_terminal`, Apache-2.0/MIT) | The grid model Warp itself forked — take it license-clean from the source, not from Warp | `vox-terminal-core::pty` child-output interpretation |

**Decision gate G-LEGAL (Phase-4):** confirm with the owner that we are *not* AGPL-licensing `vox-term`. If the owner *chooses* AGPL for the standalone app only, a literal code-vendor of Warp's blocks/Agent-Mode becomes legal — but it would have to be an isolated AGPL binary that talks to Vox over a process boundary, never a linked crate. Default assumption: **clean-room, no vendor.**

## 3. Track breakdown & dependency graph

```
T1  vox-terminal-core foundation        (critical path, sequential)
      │
      ├──────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────┐
      ▼              ▼              ▼               ▼
T2 vox-term TUI   T3 GUI Console  T4 Input router  T5 Flywheel
   (ratatui)         refactor        completion        (curation→MENS)
      │              │              │
      └──────────────┴──────────────┘
                     ▼
T6  Shell audit + Nushell/zsh/fish integration   (research gate G-SHELL → impl)
T7  Packaging / distribution (vox term binary + font)
```

- **T1 must fully land and freeze its public API before T2–T5 begin.**
- **T2, T3, T4, T5** are mutually independent once T1 is frozen → parallelizable (see §4.1).
- **T6 (Nushell)** depends on the `ShellBackend` seam (T1 Task 1.5) and edits the shared `pty`/`session` seam → run it **sequentially**, not concurrently with T2/T4 (would conflict on the seam).
- **T7** depends on T2.
- **Amendment 2026-10-08 — session host (T3 prerequisite).** Sessions are hosted in `vox-orchestrator-d` so `vox-term` and the Axis GUI attach to the *same* live session (seamless CLI↔GUI switching, shared chat context), with an in-process `LocalHost` fallback for headless builds. Tasks H1–H8 in [`terminal-session-host-design-2026.md`](../../src/architecture/terminal-session-host-design-2026.md) §9. H1–H5 land before T3; H6 *is* T3 against `term.attach` (it replaces the `TerminalSessionManager` design below); H7 extends T2. Warp fork options were evaluated and rejected (that doc §8).

## 4. Claude Code execution playbook (Sonnet 4.6: skills, workflows, subagents, gates)

Executed by **Claude 4.6 Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) via the Claude Code harness. The full operating envelope lives in [`claude-code-sonnet-handoff-limitations.md`](../../src/contributors/claude-code-sonnet-handoff-limitations.md); this section maps *this plan* onto the harness's capabilities.

### 4.1 Per-track orchestration matrix

| Track | Mode | Harness mechanism | Isolation | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **T1 core** | **Sequential, one task at a time** | `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` — fresh subagent *plans* each task, **main session writes/verifies/commits** | single worktree | T1 churns the shared public API; parallelism would thrash. |
| **T2 TUI** | Parallel-eligible after T1 freeze | one worker (own worktree) | `isolation:"worktree"` | disjoint files (`crates/vox-term/**`). |
| **T3 GUI** | Parallel-eligible after T1 freeze | one worker (own worktree) | `isolation:"worktree"` | disjoint files (`vox-gui/**`); only shares the frozen core API. |
| **T4 slash-cmds** | Parallel-eligible after T1 freeze | one worker (own worktree) | `isolation:"worktree"` | adds `core/src/commands.rs` — coordinate the single `lib.rs` re-export line with T1 owner before merge. |
| **T5 flywheel** | Parallel-eligible after T1 freeze | one worker (own worktree) | `isolation:"worktree"` | new `core/src/corpus/**`. |
| **T6 Nushell** | After T1 (needs `ShellBackend` seam) | sequential | single worktree | edits the shared `pty`/`session` seam → not safe to run concurrently with T2/T4. |
| **T7 packaging** | After T2 | sequential | single worktree | depends on the `vox-term` binary. |

### 4.2 The hard constraint that shapes everything: **read-only subagents**

In this repo's sandbox, **dispatched subagents get write/shell DENIED** (recorded gotcha). So "parallel subagents" does **not** mean parallel *writers*. Two safe patterns:

- **Default (subagent-driven-development):** the subagent reads + returns the diff/test as text; the **main session applies it, runs the gate, commits**. Use this for all of T1.
- **True parallelism (only with owner opt-in):** the **main session** drives several **git worktrees** itself (sequential apply, but the agent that *designed* each track's tasks can run concurrently as read-only planners). A `Workflow` is justified only here, and only when the owner says "use a workflow" / ultracode is on — never spin one up unprompted.

`Workflow` sketch for the post-freeze fan-out (opt-in only):

```js
// After T1 freeze. Each agent RETURNS a unified diff + the gate command output;
// the main session applies+commits. Worktree isolation prevents cross-track clobber.
const TRACKS = ['T2-tui','T3-gui','T4-cmds','T5-flywheel']
const diffs = await parallel(TRACKS.map(t => () =>
  agent(`Implement ${t} per the plan; return a unified diff + 'cargo test -p' output. Do not assume write access.`,
        { label: t, isolation: 'worktree', schema: DIFF_SCHEMA })))
// main session reviews diffs.filter(Boolean), applies, runs gates, commits per task
```

### 4.3 Efficiency rules (Sonnet 4.6 context discipline)

- **Read only the files a task names.** `vox-orchestrator`/`vox-cli` are huge; a blind read blows the window. Each Track-1 task lists its "Read first" files for exactly this reason.
- **Don't re-read what the plan already quotes.** The plan embeds the types/signatures; trust them unless a task says "verify."
- **Batch independent reads** in one message; **batch the per-crate gate** (`test` + `clippy`) rather than interleaving.
- Prefer `Grep`/`Glob` over reading whole files to locate a symbol.

### 4.4 Repo gotchas (must encode in every task)

- **Never pipe `cargo` to `head`/`grep` on Windows** — orphans thousands of processes; redirect to a file.
- **`cargo fmt --all` BANNED** → `cargo fmt -p <crate>` / `vox run scripts/fmt.vox`.
- **Clippy per-crate** (`cargo clippy -p <crate> -- -D warnings`); exclude `vox-gui` from workspace `--all-targets` clippy (Tauri build-script breaks it).
- **Web/research:** 2–3 targeted fetches, never the mass-verify workflow (trips rate-limit, mislabels abstain as "refuted").

### 4.5 Verification gate (every task, no exceptions)

`cargo test -p <crate>` **and** `cargo clippy -p <crate> -- -D warnings` **and** `cargo run -p vox-arch-check` pass, with output shown, before "done." New crate ⇒ `layers.toml` + `where-things-live.md` rows in the same commit.

### 4.6 Stop-and-ask gates

At **G-LEGAL** (AGPL?), **G-PRIV** (corpus consent), and **G-WARP** (reference-read scope) the worker **pauses and asks the owner** — never resolves unilaterally. **G-SHELL is already resolved (Nushell).** See §12.

## 5. Track 1 — `vox-terminal-core` foundation (FULL TDD)

**Crate:** `crates/vox-terminal-core/` (new). Add to root `Cargo.toml` workspace members, `layers.toml` (L3), and `where-things-live.md`.

**File map:**
- `src/lib.rs` — module wiring + public re-exports
- `src/block.rs` — `BlockId`, `BlockKind`, `BlockStatus`, `OutputChunk`, `Block`
- `src/input.rs` — `Submission`, `InputMode`, `InputIntent`, `classify()`
- `src/pty.rs` — de-Tauri'd PTY host (moved from vox-gui) + `default_shell`/`shell_integration_snippet`
- `src/osc633.rs` — Rust OSC-633 parser (ported from `osc633.ts`)
- `src/session.rs` — `Session`, `SessionEvent`, block list state machine
- `src/vox_interp.rs` — Vox-native execution adapter (from `repl.rs`)
- `src/agent.rs` — orchestrator adapter (`AgentAdapter`)
- `src/transcript.rs` — `TranscriptEvent` + journal sink
- `tests/` — integration tests per module

### Task 1.1: Scaffold the crate

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/Cargo.toml`
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/lib.rs`
- Modify: `Cargo.toml` (workspace `members`)
- Modify: `crates/vox-arch-check/layers.toml` (add `vox-terminal-core` at L3)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/smoke.rs
#[test]
fn crate_links() {
    assert_eq!(vox_terminal_core::CRATE_NAME, "vox-terminal-core");
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test smoke`
Expected: FAIL — crate/target does not exist yet.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

```toml
# crates/vox-terminal-core/Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "vox-terminal-core"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true, features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["sync", "rt", "macros"] }
portable-pty = { workspace = true }
anyhow = { workspace = true }
```

> **Dependency note (Phase-4 audit):** `portable-pty` is currently a **direct** dep in `vox-gui` (`portable-pty = "0.9"`), **not** a workspace dep. As part of this task, **promote it to `[workspace.dependencies]`** in root `Cargo.toml` (`portable-pty = "0.9"`) and switch vox-gui to `{ workspace = true }` so there is one version (DRY). `nucleo = "0.5"` is **already** a workspace dep (reused by Track 2). `ratatui`, `crossterm`, and `reedline` are **new** third-party deps introduced by Track 2 — add them to `[workspace.dependencies]` then and run the crate-build-audit / dep-currency checks.

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/src/lib.rs
//! UI-agnostic terminal + agent engine. Front-ends (ratatui TUI, GUI Console)
//! render its blocks/events and submit input back. Adapts vox-orchestrator;
//! never reimplements the agent loop.
pub const CRATE_NAME: &str = "vox-terminal-core";

pub mod block;
pub mod input;
```

Add `"crates/vox-terminal-core"` to `[workspace] members` in root `Cargo.toml` and a row in `layers.toml`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test smoke`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core Cargo.toml crates/vox-arch-check/layers.toml
git commit -m "feat(terminal-core): scaffold vox-terminal-core crate"
```

### Task 1.2: Block model

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/block.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/block.rs`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/block.rs
use vox_terminal_core::block::{Block, BlockKind, BlockStatus, OutputChunk, Stream};

use vox_terminal_core::block::BlockId;

#[test]
fn block_accumulates_output_and_finishes() {
    let mut b = Block::new(BlockId(1), BlockKind::Shell, "echo hi");
    assert_eq!(b.id, BlockId(1));
    assert_eq!(b.status, BlockStatus::Running);
    b.push(OutputChunk::text(Stream::Stdout, "hi\n"));
    b.finish(0);
    assert_eq!(b.status, BlockStatus::Ok);
    assert_eq!(b.exit_code, Some(0));
    assert_eq!(b.plain_output(), "hi\n");
}

#[test]
fn plain_output_strips_ansi() {
    let mut b = Block::new(BlockId(2), BlockKind::Shell, "ls");
    b.push(OutputChunk::text(Stream::Stdout, "\x1b[31mred\x1b[0m\n"));
    assert_eq!(b.plain_output(), "red\n"); // ANSI stripped for agent/transcript
}

#[test]
fn nonzero_exit_marks_failed() {
    let mut b = Block::new(BlockId(3), BlockKind::Shell, "false");
    b.finish(1);
    assert_eq!(b.status, BlockStatus::Failed);
    assert_eq!(b.exit_code, Some(1));
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test block`
Expected: FAIL — `block` module / types missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

```rust

            }
        } else { out.push(c); }
    }
    out
}
```

Add `pub mod block;` to `lib.rs` (already added in 1.1).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test block`
Expected: PASS (both tests).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core/src/block.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/block.rs
git commit -m "feat(terminal-core): typed Block model"
```

### Task 1.3: Input router

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/input.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/input.rs`

Routing contract (decided in brainstorming): **Vox-native is the default**; `/sh …` (or a bare `!…`) drops to the PTY shell; `/ai …` is an agent prompt; any other `/<verb> …` is a harness slash-command.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/input.rs
use vox_terminal_core::input::{classify, InputIntent};

#[test]
fn default_is_vox_native() {
    assert_eq!(classify("let x = 1"), InputIntent::VoxNative("let x = 1".into()));
}
#[test]
fn slash_sh_is_shell() {
    assert_eq!(classify("/sh git status"), InputIntent::Shell("git status".into()));
}
#[test]
fn bang_is_shell() {
    assert_eq!(classify("!ls -la"), InputIntent::Shell("ls -la".into()));
}
#[test]
fn slash_ai_is_agent() {
    assert_eq!(classify("/ai fix the failing test"), InputIntent::Agent("fix the failing test".into()));
}
#[test]
fn other_slash_is_command() {
    assert_eq!(classify("/model list"),
        InputIntent::Command { name: "model".into(), args: "list".into() });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test input`
Expected: FAIL — `input` module missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/src/input.rs
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum InputIntent {
    VoxNative(String),
    Shell(String),
    Agent(String),
    Command { name: String, args: String },
}

pub fn classify(raw: &str) -> InputIntent {
    let t = raw.trim();
    if let Some(rest) = t.strip_prefix('!') {

### Task 1.4: OSC-633 parser (Rust port of `osc633.ts`)

**Files:**
- Read first: `crates/vox-gui/ui/src/components/surfaces/Console/osc633.ts` (the reference reducer — port its semantics)
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/osc633.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/osc633.rs`

> **Phase-4 audit correction — two layers, not one.** `osc633.ts` is only a **marker reducer**: `onMarker(kind, payload, cursorLine)`. In the GUI, **xterm.js does the byte-level OSC extraction *and* owns the output buffer** (the TS `Block.output` is filled by the terminal layer, not the reducer). The headless Rust core has no xterm.js, so `osc633.rs` must do **both**: (a) byte-scan `ESC ] 633 ; … BEL`/`ST` sequences out of the PTY stream, **and** (b) capture the raw output bytes between the `C` and `D` markers as `Output(...)`. Also: the TS `decodeCommand` decodes the **general** `\xNN` hex form (`/\\x([0-9a-fA-F]{2})/`), not just three fixed escapes — the Rust `decode_command` must do the same (see corrected impl below). Marker semantics to preserve from the reducer: `A` opens a block (and finalizes any still-open block with unknown exit), `E;` sets the command, `C` marks running/output-start, `D;<exit>` finalizes, `B` is a no-op.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/osc633.rs
use vox_terminal_core::osc633::{Osc633Parser, Osc633Event};

#[test]
fn parses_command_and_exit_markers() {
    let mut p = Osc633Parser::new();
    // A (prompt start), E;<cmd>, C (pre-exec), output, D;<exit>
    let mut evs = vec![];
    evs.extend(p.feed(b"\x1b]633;A\x07"));
    evs.extend(p.feed(b"\x1b]633;E;ls -la\x07"));
    evs.extend(p.feed(b"\x1b]633;C\x07"));
    evs.extend(p.feed(b"total 0\n"));
    evs.extend(p.feed(b"\x1b]633;D;0\x07"));
    assert!(evs.contains(&Osc633Event::PromptStart));
    assert!(evs.contains(&Osc633Event::CommandLine("ls -la".into())));
    assert!(evs.contains(&Osc633Event::PreExec));
    assert!(evs.iter().any(|e| matches!(e, Osc633Event::Output(s) if s == "total 0\n")));
    assert!(evs.contains(&Osc633Event::Exit(0)));
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test osc633`
Expected: FAIL — parser missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

Implement a byte-fed scanner that recognizes `ESC ] 633 ; <payload> BEL` (and `ESC \` ST terminator), decodes the `E;` escapes (`\x5c`→`\`, `\x3b`→`;`, `\x0a`→`\n`) matching the snippets in `pty.rs`, and emits `Output(String)` for bytes between markers. Buffer partial sequences across `feed` calls.

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/src/osc633.rs  (shape — port osc633.ts semantics)
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum Osc633Event {
    PromptStart, PromptEnd, CommandLine(String), PreExec, Exit(i32), Output(String),
}

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct Osc633Parser { buf: Vec<u8> }

impl Osc633Parser {
    pub fn new() -> Self { Self::default() }
    pub fn feed(&mut self, bytes: &[u8]) -> Vec<Osc633Event> {
        self.buf.extend_from_slice(bytes);
        // scan self.buf for ESC]633;…BEL / ST, emit events, retain trailing
        // partial; emit non-marker runs as Output. (Full impl mirrors osc633.ts.)
        todo!("port from osc633.ts; keep tests above green")
    }
}
// General `\xNN` hex decode — mirror osc633.ts `decodeCommand` exactly.
fn decode_command(enc: &str) -> String {
    let bytes = enc.as_bytes();
    let mut out = String::with_capacity(enc.len());
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < bytes.len() {
        if bytes[i] == b'\\' && i + 3 < bytes.len() + 1 && bytes.get(i + 1) == Some(&b'x') {
            if let Ok(n) = u8::from_str_radix(&enc[i + 2..i + 4], 16) {
                out.push(n as char);
                i += 4;
                continue;
            }
        }
        out.push(bytes[i] as char);
        i += 1;
    }
    out
}
```

> Add a regression test asserting `decode_command("ls\\x3b\\x20rm")` yields `"ls; rm"` (general hex, not a fixed table).

> Implementer note: replace the `todo!` with the real scanner; the test in Step 1 plus a partial-sequence test (split a marker across two `feed` calls) define correctness. Add that split test before finishing.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test osc633`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core/src/osc633.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/osc633.rs
git commit -m "feat(terminal-core): Rust OSC-633 block parser (port of osc633.ts)"
```

### Task 1.5: PTY host (move + de-Tauri-fy from vox-gui)

**Files:**
- Read first: `crates/vox-gui/src/commands/pty.rs`
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/pty.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/pty.rs`

Move `default_shell`, `shell_integration_snippet`, `PWSH_OSC633`, `BASH_OSC633` **verbatim** (they are pure). Replace the Tauri command + `Emitter` with a `PtyHost::spawn(shell, cols, rows) -> (PtyHandle, mpsc::Receiver<Vec<u8>>)` API; `PtyHandle::{write, resize, kill}`.

> **Forward-compat seam (for Track 6 Nushell):** define a `ShellBackend` trait now — `submit(line) -> stream of output`, `kind() -> ShellKind` — and make `PtyShell` (this task) its first impl. Track 6 adds `NuShell` (in-process `nu-*`) as a second impl behind a `nushell` cargo feature. `Session` depends on `dyn ShellBackend`, never on `PtyShell` concretely, so the default backend can flip to Nushell without touching the session.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** (keep the existing pure-fn tests; they must pass post-move)

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/pty.rs
use vox_terminal_core::pty::{default_shell, shell_integration_snippet};

#[test]
fn default_shell_nonempty() { assert!(!default_shell().is_empty()); }
#[test]
fn snippet_supports_pwsh_and_bash() {
    assert!(shell_integration_snippet("pwsh").is_some());
    assert!(shell_integration_snippet("bash").is_some());
    assert!(shell_integration_snippet("fish").is_none()); // until Track 6
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test pty`
Expected: FAIL — `pty` module missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

Port the pure functions verbatim from `vox-gui/src/commands/pty.rs`; add the `PtyHost`/`PtyHandle` channel API (reader thread sends `Vec<u8>` over `tokio::sync::mpsc`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test pty`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Re-point vox-gui to core (no behavior change)**

In `vox-gui/src/commands/pty.rs`, delete the moved pure fns and `pub use vox_terminal_core::pty::{default_shell, shell_integration_snippet};`. Keep the `#[tauri::command]` wrappers; have `pty_spawn` drive `PtyHost` and forward the `mpsc` stream to the existing `vox://pty-output` emitter. Run `cargo test -p vox-gui` (PTY tests still green).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core/src/pty.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/pty.rs crates/vox-gui/src/commands/pty.rs
git commit -m "refactor(pty): move PTY host into vox-terminal-core; vox-gui delegates"
```

### Task 1.6: Vox-native execution adapter

**Files:**
- Read first: `crates/vox-cli/src/commands/repl.rs`
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/vox_interp.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/vox_interp.rs`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/vox_interp.rs
use vox_terminal_core::vox_interp::eval_line;

#[test]
fn evaluates_vox_expression() {
    let out = eval_line("fn main() -> Int { 40 + 2 }").unwrap();
    assert!(out.contains("42"));
}
#[test]
fn surfaces_compile_errors() {
    assert!(eval_line("let = ").is_err());
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test vox_interp`
Expected: FAIL — module missing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

Port `repl.rs`'s pipeline (`run_frontend_str_with_options` + `Interpreter::call("main", …)`) into `eval_line(src) -> Result<String>`; add `vox-compiler` as a dependency. Return rendered value / error string instead of printing.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test vox_interp`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core/src/vox_interp.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/vox_interp.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "feat(terminal-core): Vox-native execution adapter (from repl.rs)"
```

### Task 1.7: Transcript events + journal sink

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/transcript.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/transcript.rs`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/transcript.rs
use vox_terminal_core::transcript::{TranscriptEvent, TranscriptKind};

#[test]
fn event_roundtrips_json() {
    let e = TranscriptEvent { session_id: "s1".into(), seq: 1,
        kind: TranscriptKind::Submitted { intent: "Shell".into(), input: "ls".into() } };
    let j = serde_json::to_string(&e).unwrap();
    let back: TranscriptEvent = serde_json::from_str(&j).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(back, e);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test transcript`
Expected: FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

Define `TranscriptEvent { session_id, seq, kind }` and `TranscriptKind` variants `Submitted{intent,input}`, `Output{stream,text}`, `AgentTurn{text}`, `ExitStatus{code}`, `Accepted{block}`, `Rejected{block}`, `Corrected{from,to}`. Add a `JournalSink` that appends serialized events to a `vox-journal` file. (Add `vox-journal` dep.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test transcript`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core/src/transcript.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/transcript.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "feat(terminal-core): typed transcript events + journal sink"
```

### Task 1.8: Session state machine + SessionEvent stream

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/session.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/session.rs`

The `Session` owns the block list, applies `Osc633Event`s and agent events to the current block, emits `SessionEvent`s (`BlockOpened`, `OutputAppended`, `BlockClosed`, `AgentMessage`) for front-ends, and writes transcript events.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```rust
// crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/session.rs
use vox_terminal_core::session::Session;
use vox_terminal_core::block::BlockStatus;

#[test]
fn shell_block_lifecycle_from_osc_events() {
    let mut s = Session::new("s1");
    s.on_pty_bytes(b"\x1b]633;A\x07\x1b]633;E;ls\x07\x1b]633;C\x07out\n\x1b]633;D;0\x07");
    let blocks = s.blocks();
    assert_eq!(blocks.len(), 1);
    assert_eq!(blocks[0].input, "ls");
    assert_eq!(blocks[0].plain_output(), "out\n");
    assert_eq!(blocks[0].status, BlockStatus::Ok);
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test session`
Expected: FAIL.

- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

Wire `Osc633Parser` → block transitions; assign each new block a monotonically increasing `BlockId` from a session counter; expose `blocks()`, a `SessionEvent` receiver, and `submit(intent)` that routes VoxNative→`vox_interp`, Shell→`ShellBackend`, Agent/Command→`AgentAdapter` (Task 1.9). Emit transcript events on each transition.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes**

Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test session`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/vox-terminal-core/src/session.rs crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/session.rs
git commit -m "feat(terminal-core): Session block state machine + event stream"
```

### Task 1.9: Orchestrator agent adapter

**Files:**
- Read first: `crates/vox-cli/src/commands/live.rs` (event subscription pattern), `crates/vox-orchestrator/src/lib.rs` (exports)
- Create: `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/agent.rs`
- Test: `crates/vox-terminal-core/tests/agent.rs`

The adapter subscribes to `orch.event_bus()` and translates `AgentEvent` → `SessionEvent::AgentMessage` / block updates; `submit_prompt(text)` enqueues a task. **It must not reimplement the loop** — only translate.

**HITL surface (audit-confirmed API — use these exact types, no reimplementation):** reuse `vox_orchestrator::feedback::{FeedbackStore, FeedbackRequest, FeedbackResolution, FeedbackAction, Surface, FeedbackKind}`. The adapter exposes:
- `needs_you() -> Vec<FeedbackRequest>` → delegates to `FeedbackStore::open_needs_you()` (the `Surface::NeedsYou` queue). Render each as a `SessionEvent::FeedbackRequested { id, prompt, options }`.
- `respond(id, FeedbackResolution)` → delegates to `FeedbackStore::resolve(id, resolution)`, where `FeedbackResolution { action: FeedbackAction::{Answer{option,text}|Skip|Overrule|LetVerify}, decided_at_ms, decided_by }`.
- The single `FeedbackStore` is the one owned by the orchestrator (do **not** construct a second one).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — a fake `AgentEvent` (e.g. `TokenStreamed`) maps to a `SessionEvent::AgentMessage` with the streamed text. (Construct via `build_repo_scoped_orchestrator(OrchestratorConfig::default(), None)` and publish a token event, mirroring `live.rs`.)
- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify it fails.** Run: `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core --test agent`
- [ ] **Step 3: Minimal implementation** — `AgentAdapter { orch }` with `subscribe()` returning a stream of mapped `SessionEvent`s, and `submit_prompt`. Add `vox-orchestrator` dep.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run to verify it passes.**
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** — `feat(terminal-core): orchestrator agent adapter (event translation only)`

### Task 1.10: Public API freeze + arch-check

- [ ] **Step 1:** Re-export the stable surface in `lib.rs` (`block`, `input`, `osc633`, `pty`, `vox_interp`, `transcript`, `session`, `agent`).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Run `cargo test -p vox-terminal-core`, `cargo clippy -p vox-terminal-core -- -D warnings`, `cargo run -p vox-arch-check`. All green.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add the `where-things-live.md` row for `vox-terminal-core`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Commit** — `docs(terminal-core): freeze v0 public API + where-things-live row`

> **GATE:** Track 1 API is now frozen. Tracks 2–5 may begin in parallel.

---

## 6. Track 2 — `vox-term` ratatui TUI (decompose; harden in Phase-4)

**Crate:** `crates/vox-term/` (bin, L5). **File map:** `src/main.rs` (crossterm setup, event loop), `src/app.rs` (state: `Session` + view state), `src/ui/blocks.rs` (block list render), `src/ui/input.rs` (reedline input box, mode indicator), `src/ui/palette.rs` (nucleo command palette), `src/theme.rs` (IBM Plex Mono Nerd Font glyphs/colors).

**Task list (each becomes a TDD task in Phase-4):**
1. Crossterm raw-mode lifecycle + clean teardown (test: terminal restored on drop).
2. **VT-grid renderer (`src/vt.rs`)**: wrap `alacritty_terminal` — feed a block's raw output bytes into a `Term` grid, expose a `Vec<ratatui::text::Line>` projection (cells→styled spans). Test: bytes `"\x1b[31mhi\x1b[0m"` produce one red-styled span `hi`; an alternate-screen sequence (`\x1b[?1049h`) is handled without panicking. **This is the component the audit found missing — do it before Task 3.**
3. Render a block list from `Session::blocks()`, output rendered via the Task-2 VT grid (snapshot test of the ratatui buffer).
4. Input box with `reedline`; submit → `classify` → `Session::submit` (test: a `!ls` submission opens a Shell block).
5. Live `SessionEvent` subscription → repaint (test: streamed output appends to the open block and re-renders via the grid).
6. Command palette via `nucleo` over registered slash-commands (test: fuzzy "mdl"→"model").
7. Mode indicator + theme (Nerd-Font powerline glyphs; document font requirement).
8. `vox term` entry: headless check — runs under a dumb terminal / over SSH (test: starts with `TERM=dumb` without panicking).

**New deps (add to `[workspace.dependencies]`):** `ratatui`, `crossterm`, `reedline`, `alacritty_terminal` (Apache/MIT). `nucleo` already present.
**Reference (not copy):** `live.rs` for the event-render pattern.

---

## 7. Track 3 — GUI Console refactor (decompose; harden in Phase-4)

> **Superseded in part (2026-10-08):** the GUI attaches to daemon-hosted sessions via `term.attach` instead of a per-process `TerminalSessionManager`; see [`terminal-session-host-design-2026.md`](../../src/architecture/terminal-session-host-design-2026.md) task H6. The retire-`osc633.ts` and parity-verification goals below still stand.

**Goal:** the existing React Console renders the *same* core. **Surface the terminal in the same terminal view** in Axis, now backed by `vox-terminal-core` instead of TS-local logic.

**File map:**
- New Rust: `crates/vox-gui/src/commands/terminal_core.rs` — Tauri commands `term_submit`, `term_subscribe` (emits `vox://term-event` from `SessionEvent`), backed by a core `Session` per tab.
- Modify: `crates/vox-gui/ui/.../Console/Console.tsx`, `TerminalTab.tsx` — call the new commands; consume `vox://term-event`.
- **Retire:** `Console/osc633.ts` + `osc633.test.ts` once block events come from core (the Rust parser is the SSOT).
- Keep: `pty.rs` thin wrapper from Task 1.5.

**Task list (Phase-4 TDD):**
1. Add `terminal_core.rs` commands + register in the Tauri builder (test: command returns block JSON).
2. `TerminalTab.tsx` consumes `vox://term-event` instead of parsing OSC locally (vitest: a mocked term-event renders a block).
3. Delete `osc633.ts`/`osc633.test.ts`; update imports; `cargo run -p vox-arch-check` + `gui-surface-registry` parity green.
4. Verify Console parity (blocks, agent strip, send-to-agent) against pre-refactor screenshots.

---

## 8. Track 4 — Input router completion (decompose; harden in Phase-4)

Completes the harness side of `classify`'s `Command { name, args }` dispatch.

**File map:** `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/commands.rs` — a slash-command registry mapping `name`→handler over the orchestrator/CLI surface (`/model`, `/budget`, `/skills`, `/memory`, `/context`, `/sh`, `/ai`). **Task list:** registry type + 1 handler per task (TDD: `/model list` returns the model pool); wire `Session::submit` `Command` arm to it; add a `/help` listing.

---

## 9. Track 5 — VoxMENS training flywheel (decompose; harden in Phase-4)

**Scope (decided):** emit typed transcripts (Track 1) **+ curate** into a MENS-ready corpus. Trainer run itself is out of scope.

**File map:**
- `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/corpus/redact.rs` — wrap `vox-telemetry-otlp::redact_event`/`project_event` to strip secrets from transcript text.
- `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/corpus/curate.rs` — fold a session's transcript into labeled samples (accept/reject/correction pairs), dedup via `vox-similarity`.
- `crates/vox-terminal-core/src/corpus/writer.rs` — write the curated corpus to the MENS-expected location/schema.

**Task list (Phase-4 TDD):** redaction passes a secret-bearing line and asserts the secret is gone; curation turns an `Accepted`/`Rejected` pair into one labeled sample; dedup drops a near-duplicate; writer emits the agreed JSONL. **Privacy gate G-PRIV:** confirm the corpus opt-in/consent model with the owner (reuse telemetry's `VOX_TELEMETRY` off-switch posture).

---

## 10. Track 6 — Shell integration (G-SHELL **RESOLVED → Nushell**)

**Decision (owner, 2026-06-20):** the underlying AI-preferred shell is **Nushell**. Rationale: typed/structured pipelines mean `/sh` can hand the agent **structured values** (not screen-scraped text), it is Rust-native and **embeddable in-process via the `nu-*` crates** (no PTY round-trip), and it composes with the Vox-native default (both are structured). Ranking that stands: **Vox-native (default) → Nushell (structured `/sh`) → system shell (pwsh/zsh/bash) over PTY for raw muscle-memory.**

**Architecture impact on Track 1:** the shell host is **backend-pluggable** via the `ShellBackend` trait (seam built in Task 1.5). `PtyShell` is the first impl.

**Nushell integration is staged (audit finding #4 — in-process `nu-*` is heavy + API-unstable, and absent from the tree):**
- **MVP (this track):** run the `nu` binary through the **existing `PtyShell`**, requesting structured output via `… | to json`; parse the JSON into a structured payload retained on the block for the agent/transcript. No new heavy deps. Default `/sh` backend = `nu` if on PATH, else the system shell.
- **Later (feature `nushell`, optional):** an in-process `NuShell` impl via the `nu-*` crates for zero-spawn structured eval. Gated so headless/server builds skip it. Treat the `nu-*` API churn as a real risk — pin versions and isolate behind the trait.

**Tasks (now in-scope, full TDD in Phase-4 hardening):**
1. **MVP — `nu`-over-PTY**: select `nu` as the `PtyShell` program when present; append `| to json` (or detect already-structured) and parse stdout JSON into a structured payload (TDD: `ls | length` over `nu` yields a parsed numeric JSON value retained on the block).
2. Route `InputIntent::Shell` through the configured backend (TDD: default backend resolves to `nu` when on PATH, else system shell; `/sh!` forces the raw system shell).
3. Structured-output → `Block` rendering (TDD: a Nushell `to json` table renders to a `BlockKind::Shell` block with the structured payload retained for the agent/transcript).
4. Add `zsh`/`fish` OSC-633 snippets to `PtyShell` (currently `None`) for the system-shell fallback (TDD: `shell_integration_snippet("zsh").is_some()`).
5. **Later (feature `nushell`)**: in-process `NuShell: ShellBackend` via `nu-*` (TDD: `ls | length` returns a numeric value without spawning). Pin `nu-*` versions; run dep-currency/crate-build-audit when added.

---

## 11. Track 7 — Packaging / distribution

`vox-term` binary built and shipped; **IBM Plex Mono Nerd Font** documented as the recommended terminal font (and bundled where the installer can). Add a `vox term` alias from `vox-cli`. Headless/SSH smoke test in CI. Follows the existing single-command install program (see memory: install/release/publish program).

---

## 12. Research / decision gates (consolidated)

| Gate | Phase | Question | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| G-LEGAL | 4 | Is `vox-term` AGPL or not? (Determines whether *any* Warp code can be vendored.) | Owner decision; default = clean-room, no vendor |
| G-SHELL | ✅ RESOLVED | Which underlying shell is "ideal for LLM generation"? | **Nushell** (structured pipelines, in-process `nu-*`); see §10 |
| G-PRIV | 5 | Corpus consent/opt-in model | Owner decision; reuse telemetry off-switch |
| G-WARP | 3 | Deep-read Warp's block/Agent-Mode crates for clean-room patterns | Targeted read of AGPL crates *as reference only* |

---

## 13. Self-review (against the brainstorming design)

- **Form factor (TUI, runs anywhere):** Track 2 + Track 7 (headless/SSH smoke tests). ✓
- **SSOT (extract shared core):** Track 1 is the core; Tracks 2/3 are renderers; §1 forbids reimplementing the loop. ✓

## 14. Phase-4 audit log (what was verified against the code, and corrections)

Read against the real tree on 2026-06-20:

- **`osc633.ts` is a marker reducer, not a byte parser** — xterm.js owns byte-extraction + output buffering in the GUI. *Correction applied:* Task 1.4 now mandates a two-layer Rust parser (byte-scan **+** output capture) and a general `\xNN` hex `decode_command` (the original 3-escape version was a bug). Verified semantics: `A` opens/auto-finalizes, `E;` cmd, `C` running, `D;<exit>` finalize, `B` no-op.
- **`portable-pty` is a direct vox-gui dep (`"0.9"`), not a workspace dep.** *Correction applied:* Task 1.1 promotes it to `[workspace.dependencies]`; `nucleo = "0.5"` already exists; `ratatui`/`crossterm`/`reedline` are new (added in Track 2).
- **Orchestrator event surface verified:** `vox-orchestrator/src/events.rs` — `AgentEvent` (L93), `AgentEventKind` (L116) incl. `TokenStreamed` (L385); `event_bus().subscribe()` returns `broadcast::Receiver<AgentEvent>` (L769). Task 1.9's adapter contract holds (translate-only, mirrors `live.rs`).
- **Feedback module surface:** `feedback/mod.rs` re-exports `store::*`, `surface_policy::*`, `types::*` — HITL types live in `feedback::store`/`feedback::types`. Adapter reuses these; no reimplementation.
### Pre-execution adversarial audit (2026-06-20, parallel Explore agents) — findings applied

- **🔴 #1 Missing VT emulation (FIXED):** the GUI delegates ANSI/cursor/color to **xterm.js** (`TerminalTab.tsx:89`); headless ratatui has nothing → raw bytes would render literally and vim/htop break. No task used the `alacritty_terminal` named in §2. *Applied:* core stays VT-agnostic + `strip_ansi` for `plain_output()`; **Track 2 Task 2 adds an `alacritty_terminal` VT grid** in `vox-term`. (Confirmed: `vte`/`alacritty_terminal`/`ratatui`/`crossterm`/`reedline`/`nu-*` are ALL absent from the tree today.)
- **🔴 #2 Wrong layer (FIXED):** layers.toml has **no L4**; binaries are **L5**. `vox-term` corrected L4→L5. `vox-terminal-core` at L3 confirmed legal (same-layer deps allowed; vox-gui→orchestrator already a known inversion → no cycle).
- **🟠 #3 Heavy core (FIXED):** `vox-compiler` ~47k LoC (reqwest/rayon/compression), `vox-orchestrator` ~70k LoC. *Applied:* feature gates `vox-lang` / `agent` / `nushell`; minimal default features.
- **🟠 #4 Nushell embedding risk (FIXED):** in-process `nu-*` heavy + API-unstable. *Applied:* Track 6 MVP = `nu`-over-PTY with `to json`; in-process behind optional `nushell` feature.
- **🟡 #5 `Block` had no `id` (FIXED):** added `id: BlockId`; Session assigns from a counter.
- **🟢 #6 HITL API now concrete (CAVEAT REMOVED):** Task 1.9 specifies `FeedbackStore::{open_needs_you, resolve}` + `FeedbackResolution{action: Answer/Skip/Overrule/LetVerify}`.
- **🟡 #7 `VoxValue` Debug-only:** `eval_line` returns `{val:?}` (`Int(42)` not `42`) for MVP; a `Display`/`render_value` for `VoxValue` is a tracked follow-up (not blocking).

- **Still UNVERIFIED (carry into handoff as caveats):** whether the per-tab `Session` model maps cleanly onto the GUI's existing `PtyManager` tab lifecycle (Track 3 — read the Console surfaces first); the precise MENS corpus schema (Track 5, gated by G-PRIV). Read before the affected task, do not assume.

**Placeholder scan:** the only deliberate `todo!` is in Task 1.4 Step 3, bounded by the tests in that task plus a required split-sequence test — not a plan gap. **Type consistency:** `Block`/`BlockKind`/`BlockStatus`/`OutputChunk`/`Stream`, `InputIntent`, `Osc633Event`, `SessionEvent`, `TranscriptEvent`/`TranscriptKind`, `PtyHost`/`PtyHandle`, `AgentAdapter` are used consistently across tasks.
